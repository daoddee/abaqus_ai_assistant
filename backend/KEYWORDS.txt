Warning: Abaqus/Explicit does not admit jumps in mesh displacement. If no amplitude is speciﬁed,
Abaqus/Explicit will ignore the user-supplied displacement value and enforce a zero mesh motion constraint.
This option is used to prescribe independent mesh motion for nodes in an adaptive mesh domain or to deﬁne
nodes that must follow the material. It can be used only in conjunction with the *ADAPTIVE MESH option.

. The default value is 
.
GEOMETRIC ENHANCEMENT
Set GEOMETRIC ENHANCEMENT=YES (default in Abaqus/Explicit analyses) to use smoothing

INITIAL FEATURE ANGLE
47
*ADAPTIVE MESH CONTROLS

Set this parameter equal to the initial geometric feature angle, 
, in degrees (
). This

. Setting 
will ensure that no geometric edges or corners are detected or enforced.
MESH CONSTRAINT ANGLE
This parameter applies only to Abaqus/Explicit analyses.
Set this parameter equal to the mesh constraint angle, 
, in degrees (
). The default
value is 
.
When adaptive mesh constraints are applied to nodes on Lagrangian or sliding boundary regions,
the analysis will terminate if the angle between the normal to the boundary region and the direction
of the prescribed constraint becomes less than 
. When adaptive mesh constraints are applied to
nodes that are part of a Lagrangian or active geometric edge, the analysis will terminate if the angle
between the prescribed constraint and the plane perpendicular to the edge becomes less than 
.
MESHING PREDICTOR
This parameter is interpreted differently in Abaqus/Explicit and Abaqus/Standard analyses.
In an Abaqus/Explicit analysis, set MESHING PREDICTOR=CURRENT (default if the adaptive
mesh domain has no Eulerian boundary regions) to perform adaptive meshing based on current
nodal positions; this method is recommended for all Lagrangian-like problems and for problems
with very large distortions. Set MESHING PREDICTOR=PREVIOUS (default if the adaptive mesh
domain has one or more Eulerian boundary regions) to perform adaptive meshing based on the
positions of the nodes at the end of the previous adaptive mesh increment; this technique is
recommended for Eulerian-like problems where material ﬂow is signiﬁcant compared to the overall
deformation.
In an Abaqus/Standard analysis, set MESHING PREDICTOR=CURRENT to perform adaptive
meshing based on the positions of the nodes at the start of the current adaptive mesh increment. Set
MESHING PREDICTOR=PREVIOUS (default) to perform adaptive meshing based on the nodal
positions in the original mesh.
MOMENTUM ADVECTION
This parameter applies only to Abaqus/Explicit analyses.
Set MOMENTUM ADVECTION=ELEMENT CENTER PROJECTION (default) to use the element
center projection method for advecting momentum. This method is less expensive than the half-index
shift method.
Set MOMENTUM ADVECTION=HALF INDEX SHIFT to use the half-index shift method for
momentum advection. This algorithm is more expensive computationally but may demonstrate
better dispersion properties than the element center projection method.
RESET
Include this parameter to reset all adaptive mesh controls to their default values. Controls that are
speciﬁed with other parameters on the same *ADAPTIVE MESH CONTROLS option are retained.
If this parameter is omitted, only the speciﬁed controls will be changed in the current step; the others
will remain at their settings from previous steps.
SMOOTHING OBJECTIVE
This parameter applies only to Abaqus/Explicit analyses.
Set SMOOTHING OBJECTIVE=UNIFORM (default if the adaptive mesh domain has no Eulerian
boundary regions in explicit dynamic analysis) to perform adaptive meshing that minimizes element

This objective is recommended for problems with moderate to large overall deformation.
Set SMOOTHING OBJECTIVE=GRADED (default if the adaptive mesh domain has one or more
Eulerian boundary regions in explicit dynamic analysis) to perform adaptive meshing that attempts
to preserve initial mesh gradation while reducing distortions as the analysis evolves. This objective
is recommended only for adaptive mesh domains with reasonably structured graded meshes
undergoing low to moderate overall deformation.
TRANSITION FEATURE ANGLE
Set this parameter equal to the transition geometric feature angle, 
, in degrees (
).
This angle is used to determine when geometric edges and corners should be deactivated to allow
remeshing across them. The default value is 
. Setting 
 will ensure that no geometric
edges or corners are deactivated.
Data line to define weights for combining the mesh smoothing methods in Abaqus/Explicit
analyses:
First (and only) line:
1. The weight for the volumetric smoothing method. The default is 1.0.
2. The weight for the Laplacian smoothing method. The default is 0.0.
3. The weight for the equipotential smoothing method. The default is 0.0.
Each of the weights must be zero or positive and their sum should typically be 1.0. If the sum of the weights is
less than 1.0, the mesh smoothing algorithm will be less aggressive at each adaptive mesh increment. If the sum
of the weights is greater than 1.0, their values are normalized so that their sum is 1.0.
Data line to define weights for combining the mesh smoothing methods in Abaqus/Standard
analyses:

material properties are constant or depend only on temperature. See Specifying Field Variable
Dependence for more information.
LINEARIZATION STRETCH
This parameter applies only if DEFINITION=HOLZAPFEL-OGDEN.
Set LINEARIZATION STRETCH=
 to indicate that the second and third exponential terms in
the Holzapfel-Ogden strain energy potential are linearized/approximated by polynomial functions
when ﬁber stretches reach 
. The value of 
 should be greater than or equal to 1.
If this parameter is omitted, the exponential terms in the strain energy potential are not linearized.
LOCAL DIRECTIONS
This parameter can be used only in combination with invariant-based strain energy potentials, such
as DEFINITION=HOLZAPFEL-GASSER-OGDEN; DEFINITION=HOLZAPFEL-OGDEN;
DEFINITION=KALISKE-SCHMIDT; and DEFINITION=USER, FORMULATION=INVARIANT.
Set this parameter equal to the number of preferred local directions (or ﬁber directions) in the
material. The default is LOCAL DIRECTIONS=0.
When LOCAL DIRECTIONS=N, the deﬁnitions of the N local direction vectors in the reference
conﬁguration are speciﬁed using the *ORIENTATION, LOCAL DIRECTIONS=M option, with M
  N. If M > N, the ﬁrst N directions are used.
If the Holzapfel-Gasser-Ogden, Holzapfel-Ogden, or Kaliske-Schmidt strain energy potential is
used, you must specify at least one local direction.
MODULI
This parameter is applicable only when the *ANISOTROPIC HYPERELASTIC option is used in
conjunction with the *VISCOELASTIC option.
Set MODULI=INSTANTANEOUS to indicate that the anisotropic hyperelastic material constants
deﬁne the instantaneous behavior. This parameter value is not available for frequency domain
viscoelasticity in an Abaqus/Standard analysis. This is the only option available if the anisotropic
hyperelastic potential is deﬁned in a user subroutine.
Set MODULI=LONG TERM to indicate that the hyperelastic material constants deﬁne the long-term
behavior. This option is not available when a user subroutine is used to deﬁne the anisotropic
hyperelastic potential. It is the default for all other anisotropic hyperelastic models.
PROPERTIES
This parameter applies only if DEFINITION=USER is speciﬁed.
Set this parameter equal to the number of property values needed as data in user subroutines
UANISOHYPER_INV and UANISOHYPER_STRAIN in Abaqus/Standard or VUANISOHYPER_INV
and VUANISOHYPER_STRAIN in Abaqus/Explicit. The default value is 0.

Required parameters:
DOF
Set this parameter equal to the direction (1–6, including rotations) for which the base motion is
being deﬁned. For primary base motion, this direction is always speciﬁed in the global coordinate
system. For secondary base motion, you can specify the degree of freedom in either the global
(default) or local direction at a node with applied coordinate transformations, depending on the
value of the DIRECTION parameter.

motions only in the high-performance implementation of the modal analysis procedures.
Required parameter for *MODAL DYNAMIC and *STEADY STATE DYNAMICS analyses:
AMPLITUDE
Set this parameter equal to the name of the *AMPLITUDE option that deﬁnes the time history
(*MODAL DYNAMIC) or frequency spectrum (*STEADY STATE DYNAMICS) of the motion. This
parameter is irrelevant for the *RANDOM RESPONSE procedure. The parameter
DEFINITION=SOLUTION DEPENDENT cannot be used in an *AMPLITUDE referenced by this

axes. For secondary base motion, use this parameter to deﬁne the coordinate system in which
mechanical degrees of freedom (1–6) are applied.
77
*BASE MOTION

Set DIRECTION=GLOBAL (default) to apply the base motion in the direction of the global
coordinate axes. To specify secondary base motion in a global direction at a node at which a
coordinate transformation is applied, you must specify all three translational degrees of freedom
(1–3) or all three rotational degrees of freedom (4–6) in the named boundary condition in the
frequency extraction procedure if the base motion is translational or rotational, respectively.
Set DIRECTION=LOCAL to apply the secondary base motion in the local direction along one of
the coordinate axes of the transformed coordinate systems at the base nodes as deﬁned by the

IMAGINARY
Include this parameter to deﬁne the imaginary (out-of-phase) part of the base motion record given
by the amplitude deﬁnition.

This option is used in conjunction with the *BEAM SECTION or *BEAM GENERAL SECTION option to deﬁne
additional mass and rotary inertia per unit length in shear ﬂexible Timoshenko beam elements. This option is
also used to deﬁne mass proportional damping (for direct-integration dynamic analysis) and in Abaqus/Standard
composite damping (for modal dynamic analysis) associated with the added inertia.

COMPOSITE
This parameter applies only to Abaqus/Standard analyses.
Set this parameter equal to the fraction of critical damping to be used with the beam elements when

1. Mass per unit length.
2. Local 1-coordinate of the center of mass within the beam cross-section,

4. Orientation angle for the ﬁrst axis of the oriented system relative to the ﬁrst beam cross-sectional
direction in which the rotary inertia is given,  (in degrees). Only relevant for beams in space;
otherwise, leave blank.
5. Rotary inertia around the center of mass about the 1-axis in the local inertia system,

Required parameters:
ELSET
Set this parameter equal to the name of the element set for which the section is deﬁned.
Required parameter in Abaqus/Explicit, optional parameter in Abaqus/Standard:
DENSITY
Set this parameter equal to the mass density (mass per unit volume) of the beam material. In an
Abaqus/Standard analysis this parameter is needed only when the mass of the elements is required,
such as in dynamic analysis or gravity loading. This parameter cannot be used when
SECTION=MESHED.
If the MATERIAL parameter is omitted, this density accounts for the mass of the beam because no
material deﬁnition is provided.
If the MATERIAL parameter is included, the mass density from the material deﬁnition is ignored.
If the DENSITY parameter is omitted, the mass density from the material deﬁnition is used.
Optional parameters:
CONTROLS
In an Abaqus/Explicit analysis, set this parameter equal to the name of a section controls deﬁnition
(see *SECTION CONTROLS) to be used to specify bulk viscosity scale factors or to an amplitude
name (see *AMPLITUDE) to ramp up the initial stress.
In an Abaqus/Standard analysis, set this parameter equal to the name of a section controls deﬁnition
(see *SECTION CONTROLS) to be used in a subsequent Abaqus/Explicit import analysis.
DEPENDENCIES
This parameter cannot be used when SECTION=NONLINEAR GENERAL, when
SECTION=MESHED, or when the MATERIAL parameter is included.
Set this parameter equal to the number of ﬁeld variable dependencies included in the deﬁnition of
material moduli, in addition to temperature. If this parameter is omitted, it is assumed that the moduli
are constant or depend only on temperature.

*BEAM GENERAL SECTION

LUMPED
This parameter is relevant only for linear Timoshenko beam elements in Abaqus/Standard.
Set LUMPED=YES (default) to use a lumped mass matrix in frequency extraction and modal analysis
procedures.
Set LUMPED=NO to use a mass matrix based on a cubic interpolation of deﬂection and quadratic
interpolation of the rotation ﬁelds in frequency extraction and modal analysis procedures.
MATERIAL
This parameter cannot be used when SECTION=NONLINEAR GENERAL or SECTION=MESHED.
It also cannot be used when the DEPENDENCIES or ZERO parameters are included.
Set this parameter equal to the name of the material to be used with this beam section deﬁnition.
POISSON
Set this parameter equal to the effective Poisson's ratio for the section to provide uniform strain in
the section due to strain of the beam axis (so that the cross-sectional area changes when the beam
is stretched). The value of the effective Poisson's ratio must be between −1.0 and 0.5. The default
is POISSON=0. A value of 0.5 enforces incompressible behavior of the element.
For PIPE elements with SECTION=PIPE, this parameter is also used along with the Young's modulus
given on the third data line to compute the axial strain due to hoop strain.
This parameter is used only in large-displacement analysis. It is not used with element types B23,
B33, or the equivalent “hybrid” elements (which are available only in Abaqus/Standard).
ROTARY INERTIA
This parameter is relevant only for three-dimensional Timoshenko beam elements.
Set ROTARY INERTIA=EXACT (default) to use the exact rotary inertia corresponding to the beam
cross-section geometry in dynamic and eigenfrequency extraction procedures.
Set ROTARY INERTIA=ISOTROPIC to use an approximate rotary inertia for the cross-section.
In Abaqus/Standard the rotary inertia associated with the torsional mode of deformation is used for
all rotational degrees of freedom. In Abaqus/Explicit the rotary inertia for all rotational degrees of
freedom is equal to a scaled ﬂexural inertia with a scaling factor chosen to maximize the stable time
increment. ROTARY INERTIA=ISOTROPIC is not relevant and cannot be used when
SECTION=MESHED; the default value of EXACT always applies for meshed sections.
SECTION

Required parameters:
ELSET
Set this parameter equal to the name of the element set for which this section is deﬁned.
MATERIAL
Set this parameter equal to the name of the material to be used with this beam section deﬁnition.
SECTION
Set this parameter equal to the name of the section type (see Beam Cross-Section Library). The
following cross-sections are available for beam elements:
•
ARBITRARY, for an arbitrary section.
•
BOX, for a rectangular, hollow box section.
•
CIRC, for a solid circular section.

Optional parameters:
CONTROLS
In an Abaqus/Explicit analysis, set this parameter equal to the name of a section controls deﬁnition
(see *SECTION CONTROLS) to be used to specify bulk viscosity scale factors or to an amplitude
name (see *AMPLITUDE) to ramp up the initial stress.
Abaqus Keywords Guide
90
*BEAM SECTION

In an Abaqus/Standard analysis, set this parameter equal to the name of a section controls deﬁnition
(see *SECTION CONTROLS) to be used in a subsequent Abaqus/Explicit import analysis.
LUMPED
This parameter is relevant only for linear Timoshenko beam elements in Abaqus/Standard.
Set LUMPED=YES (default) to use a lumped mass matrix in frequency extraction and modal analysis
procedures.
Set LUMPED=NO to use a mass matrix based on a cubic interpolation of deﬂection and quadratic
interpolation of the rotation ﬁelds in frequency extraction and modal analysis procedures.
POISSON
Set this parameter equal to the effective Poisson's ratio for the section to provide uniform strain in
the section because of strain of the beam axis (so that the beam changes cross-sectional area when
it is stretched). The value of the effective Poisson's ratio must be between −1.0 and 0.5. The default
is POISSON=0. A value of 0.5 will enforce incompressible behavior of the element.
This parameter is used only in large-displacement analyses. It is not used with elbow elements or
with element types B23, B33, PIPE21, PIPE22, and the equivalent “hybrid” elements (which are
available only in Abaqus/Standard).
ROTARY INERTIA
This parameter is relevant only for three-dimensional Timoshenko beam elements.
Set ROTARY INERTIA=EXACT (default) to use the exact rotary inertia corresponding to the beam
cross-section geometry in dynamic and eigenfrequency extraction procedures.
Set ROTARY INERTIA=ISOTROPIC to use an approximate rotary inertia for the cross-section.
In Abaqus/Standard the rotary inertia associated with the torsional mode of deformation is used for
all rotational degrees of freedom. In Abaqus/Explicit the rotary inertia for all rotational degrees of
freedom is equal to a scaled ﬂexural inertia with a scaling factor chosen to maximize the stable time
increment.
TEMPERATURE
Use this parameter to select the mode of temperature and ﬁeld variable input used on the *FIELD,
the *INITIAL CONDITIONS, or the *TEMPERATURE options.
For beam elements set TEMPERATURE=GRADIENTS (default) to specify temperatures and ﬁeld
variables as values at the origin of the cross-section, together with gradients with respect to the
2-direction and, for beams in space, the 1-direction of the section. Set TEMPERATURE=VALUES
to give temperatures and ﬁeld variables as values at the points shown in the beam section descriptions
(see Beam Cross-Section Library).
For elbow elements set TEMPERATURE=GRADIENTS (default) to specify temperatures and ﬁeld
variables at the middle of the pipe wall and the gradient through the pipe thickness. Set
TEMPERATURE=VALUES to give temperatures and ﬁeld variables as values at points through
the section, as shown in Pipes and Pipebends with Deforming Cross-Sections: Elbow Elements.

AMPLITUDE
This parameter is ignored in a one-step inverse procedure.
This parameter is relevant only when some of the variables being prescribed have nonzero magnitudes.

If this parameter is omitted in an Abaqus/Standard analysis, either the reference magnitude is applied

There are two exceptions. The ﬁrst is when displacement or rotation components are given with

In an Abaqus/Standard dynamic or modal dynamic procedure, amplitude curves speciﬁed for
TYPE=DISPLACEMENT or TYPE=VELOCITY will be smoothed automatically. In an
Abaqus/Explicit analysis, the user must request that such amplitude curves are smoothed. For more
information, see Amplitude Curves.
BLOCKING
This parameter applies only to Abaqus/Explicit analyses when the USER parameter is speciﬁed.
Set BLOCKING=YES (default) to enable blocking for a given node set. The blocking size will be
set to a predeﬁned value in Abaqus/Explicit.
Set BLOCKING=NO to disable blocking.
FIXED
This parameter applies only to Abaqus/Standard analyses and cannot be used with the TYPE and
USER parameters.
Include this parameter to indicate that the values of the variables being prescribed with this
*BOUNDARY option remain ﬁxed throughout the step using the values at the start of the step. If
this parameter is used, any magnitudes given on the data lines are ignored.
This parameter should be used only with the "direct" format to specify the degrees of freedom to
ﬁx (see Boundary Conditions).
Except for a one-step inverse procedure, this parameter is ignored if it is used in the ﬁrst step of an
analysis. If this parameter is used for a one-step inverse procedure, all the degrees of freedom of
the nodes given on the data lines are constrained based on their initial reference conﬁguration.
LOAD CASE
This parameter applies only to Abaqus/Standard analyses. It is ignored in all procedures except
*BUCKLE.
Set this parameter equal to 1 (default) or 2. LOAD CASE=1 can be used to deﬁne boundary conditions
for the applied loads, and LOAD CASE=2 can be used to deﬁne antisymmetry boundary conditions
for the buckling modes.
NAME
This parameter applies only to Abaqus/Explicit analyses when the USER parameter is speciﬁed.
Set this parameter equal to the name that will be used to reference the boundary condition in user
subroutine VDISP. Boundary names that appear in an Abaqus/Explicit analysis must be unique.
They cannot begin with a number, and they must adhere to the naming convention for labels. See
Input Syntax Rules for the syntax of such names.
OP
This parameter is ignored in a one-step inverse procedure.
Set OP=MOD (default) to modify existing boundary conditions or to add boundary conditions to
degrees of freedom that were previously unconstrained.
Set OP=NEW if all boundary conditions that are currently in effect should be removed. To remove
only selected boundary conditions, use OP=NEW and respecify all boundary conditions that are to
be retained.
If a boundary condition is removed in a stress/displacement analysis in Abaqus/Standard, it will be
replaced by a concentrated force equal to the reaction force calculated at the restrained degree of
freedom at the end of the previous step. If the step is a general nonlinear analysis step, this
101

*BOUNDARY

concentrated force will then be removed according to the AMPLITUDE parameter on the *STEP
option. Therefore, if the default amplitudes are used, the concentrated force will be reduced linearly
to zero over the period of the step in a static analysis and immediately in a dynamic analysis.
The OP parameter must be the same for all uses of the *BOUNDARY option within a single step
except in a *BUCKLE step, where OP=NEW can be used with LOAD CASE=2 even when OP=MOD
is used with LOAD CASE=1.
PHANTOM
This parameter applies only to enriched elements in Abaqus/Standard.
Set PHANTOM=NODE to apply boundary conditions to a phantom node that is originally located
coincident with the speciﬁed real node in an enriched element.
Set PHANTOM=EDGE to apply boundary conditions to a phantom node located at an element edge
between the two speciﬁed real corner nodes in an enriched element. This setting applies only to
nodes with pore pressure degrees of freedom.
Set PHANTOM=INCLUDED to indicate that the boundary conditions applied to a phantom node
located at an element edge will be interpolated automatically from the speciﬁed real corner nodes
when the enriched element is cracked. This setting applies only to nodes with pore pressure degrees
of freedom.
REGION TYPE
This parameter applies only to Abaqus/Explicit analyses.
This parameter is relevant only for boundary conditions applied to nodes on the boundary of an
adaptive mesh domain. If boundary conditions are applied to nodes in the interior of an adaptive
mesh domain, these nodes will always follow the material. Abaqus/Explicit will create a Lagrangian
boundary region automatically for surface-type constraints (symmetry planes, moving boundary
planes, and fully clamped boundaries).
Set REGION TYPE=LAGRANGIAN (default) to apply the boundary conditions to a Lagrangian
boundary region. The edge of a Lagrangian boundary region will follow the material while allowing
adaptive meshing along the edge and in the interior of the region.
Set REGION TYPE=SLIDING to deﬁne a sliding boundary region. The edge of a sliding boundary
region will slide over the material. Adaptive meshing will occur on the edge and in the interior of
the region. Mesh constraints are typically applied on the edge of a sliding boundary region to ﬁx it
spatially.
Set REGION TYPE=EULERIAN to apply the boundary conditions to an Eulerian boundary region.
This option is used to create a boundary region across which material can ﬂow and is typically used
with velocity boundary conditions. Mesh constraints must be used normal to an Eulerian boundary
region to allow material to ﬂow through the region. If no mesh constraints are applied, an Eulerian
boundary region will behave in the same way as a sliding boundary region.
TYPE
This parameter cannot be used with the FIXED parameter.
This parameter is used in a stress/displacement analysis to specify whether the magnitude is in the
form of a displacement history, a velocity history, or an acceleration history. In an Abaqus/Standard
analysis TYPE=VELOCITY should normally be used to specify ﬁnite rotations.
Set TYPE=DISPLACEMENT (default) to give a displacement history. Abaqus/Explicit does not
admit jumps in displacement. If no amplitude is speciﬁed, Abaqus/Explicit will ignore the
user-supplied displacement value and enforce a zero displacement boundary condition. See Boundary
Conditions for details.
Abaqus Keywords Guide
102
*BOUNDARY

Set TYPE=VELOCITY to give a velocity history. Velocity histories can be speciﬁed in static
analyses in Abaqus/Standard, as discussed in “Prescribing large rotations” in Boundary Conditions.
In this case the default variation is STEP.
Set TYPE=ACCELERATION to give an acceleration history. Acceleration histories should not be
used in static analysis steps in Abaqus/Standard.
If amplitude functions are speciﬁed as piecewise linear functions in Abaqus/Explicit and a
displacement history is used, there will be a jump in the velocity and a spike in the acceleration at
points on the curve where the curve changes slope. This will result in a “noisy” solution. If possible,
use *AMPLITUDE, DEFINITION=SMOOTH STEP; *AMPLITUDE, SMOOTH; or *BOUNDARY,
TYPE=VELOCITY or TYPE=ACCELERATION. For TYPE=ACCELERATION the value of the
initial velocity (given in *INITIAL CONDITIONS, TYPE=VELOCITY) must be speciﬁed to obtain
the correct displacement history.
USER
This parameter cannot be used with the FIXED parameter.
For Abaqus/Standard include this parameter to indicate that any nonzero magnitudes associated
with variables prescribed through this option can be redeﬁned in user subroutine DISP. Any
magnitudes deﬁned on the data lines of the option (and possibly modiﬁed by the AMPLITUDE
parameter) will be passed into user subroutine DISP and can be redeﬁned in subroutine DISP. The
value of the TYPE parameter is ignored when this option is used.
For Abaqus/Explicit include this parameter to indicate that the boundary value associated with
variables prescribed through this option are to be deﬁned in user subroutine VDISP. Any magnitudes
deﬁned on the data lines of the option are ignored and the amplitude, if the AMPLITUDE parameter
is included, is passed into the VDISP routine for your usage. The type of user prescribed variable
in subroutine VDISP is determined by the TYPE parameter. The NAME parameter can be used in
user subroutine VDISP to distinguish multiple boundary conditions. Only translational and rotational
degrees of freedom are supported for user-prescribed boundary conditions.
Optional, mutually exclusive parameters for matrix generation and direct-solution, steady-state
dynamics analysis (history data only):
IMAGINARY
Include this parameter to deﬁne the imaginary (out-of-phase) part of the boundary condition.
REAL
Include this parameter (default) to deﬁne the real (in-phase) part of the part of the boundary condition.

4. Actual magnitude of the variable (displacement, velocity, or acceleration, etc.). This magnitude

ignored (see Boundary Conditions). In Abaqus/Standard the magnitude can be redeﬁned in user

redeﬁned in user subroutine VDISP if the USER parameter is included. In this case the input

Submodel boundary conditions
Required parameters:
STEP
Set this parameter equal to the step number in the global analysis for which the values of the driven
variables will be read during this step of the submodel analysis.
SUBMODEL
Include this parameter to specify that the boundary conditions are the “driven variables” in a submodel
analysis. Nodes used in this option must be listed in the *SUBMODEL model deﬁnition option.
Optional parameters:
INC
This parameter can be used only in a static linear perturbation step (General and Perturbation
Procedures). Set this parameter equal to the increment in the selected step of the global analysis at
which the solution will be used to specify the values of the driven variables. By default,
Abaqus/Standard will use the solution at the last increment of the selected step.
OP
Set OP=MOD (default) for existing *BOUNDARY conditions to remain, with this option deﬁning
boundary conditions to be added or modiﬁed.
Set OP=NEW if all boundary conditions that are currently in effect should be removed. To remove
only selected boundary conditions, use OP=NEW and respecify all boundary conditions that are to
be retained.
If a boundary condition is removed in a stress/displacement analysis, it will be replaced by a
concentrated force equal to the reaction force calculated at the restrained degree of freedom at the
end of the previous step. If the step is a general nonlinear analysis step, this concentrated force will
then be removed according to the AMPLITUDE parameter on the *STEP option. Therefore, by
default the concentrated force will be reduced linearly to zero over the period of the step in a static
analysis and immediately in a dynamic analysis.
The OP parameter must be the same for all uses of the *BOUNDARY option in a step.
SCALE
Set this parameter equal to the value by which the driven variables read from the global analysis
are to be scaled. The default is SCALE=1.0.
TIMESCALE
If the submodel analysis step time is different from the global analysis step time, use the TIMESCALE
parameter to adjust the time variable for the driven nodes' amplitude functions. The time variable
of each driven node's amplitude function is scaled to match the submodel analysis step time. If this
parameter is omitted, the time variable is not scaled.

Optional parameters:
FILM AMPLITUDE
Set this parameter equal to the name of the *AMPLITUDE option that gives the variation of the ﬁlm
coefﬁcient, h, with time.
If this parameter is omitted, the reference ﬁlm coefﬁcient is applied immediately at the beginning
of the step and kept constant over the step.
The FILM AMPLITUDE parameter is ignored if a ﬁlm coefﬁcient is deﬁned to be a function of
temperature and ﬁeld variables via the *FILM PROPERTY option.
For nonuniform ﬁlm coefﬁcients, the ﬁlm coefﬁcient amplitude is deﬁned in user subroutine FILM
in Abaqus/Standard or user subroutine VFILM in Abaqus/Explicit; and FILM AMPLITUDE
references are used only to modify the ﬁlm coefﬁcient passed into the user subroutine.
OP
Set OP=MOD (default) for existing *CFILMs to remain, with this option modifying existing ﬁlms
or deﬁning additional ﬁlms.
Set OP=NEW if all existing *CFILMs applied to the model should be removed.

applies only to nodes with both pore pressure and temperature degrees of freedom.
REGION TYPE

region to allow material to ﬂow through the region. If no mesh constraints are applied, an Eulerian
boundary region will behave in the same way as a sliding boundary region.

*CLOAD: Specify concentrated forces and moments.
This option is used to apply concentrated forces and moments at any node in the model. The *CLOAD option
can also be used to specify concentrated buoyancy, drag, and inertia loads in an Abaqus/Aqua analysis.

Applying concentrated loads
Required parameter for reading concentrated nodal force from an output database file:
FILE
Set this parameter equal to the name of the output database ﬁle from which the data are to be read.
The ﬁle extension is optional.
Required parameter for cyclic symmetry models in steady-state dynamics analyses:
CYCLIC MODE
Set this parameter equal to the cyclic symmetry mode number of loads that are applied in the current
steady-state dynamics procedure.
Optional parameters:
AMPLITUDE
Set this parameter equal to the name of the amplitude curve that deﬁnes the magnitude of the load
during the step.
If this parameter is omitted in an Abaqus/Standard analysis, the reference magnitude is applied
immediately at the beginning of the step or linearly over the step, depending on the value assigned
to the AMPLITUDE parameter on the *STEP option (see Deﬁning an Analysis). If this parameter
is omitted in an Abaqus/Explicit analysis, the reference magnitude is applied immediately at the
beginning of the step.
FOLLOWER
Include this parameter if the direction of the load is assumed to rotate with the rotation at this node.
This parameter should be used only for large-displacement analysis and can be used only at nodes
with active rotational degrees of freedom (such as the nodes of beam or shell elements).
159
*CLOAD

Concentrated buoyancy, drag, and ﬂuid inertia loads in Abaqus/Aqua analyses are automatically
considered to be follower forces, so this parameter is not necessary in those cases.
In general, UNSYMM=YES should be used on the *STEP option in conjunction with the
FOLLOWER parameter in *DYNAMIC and *STATIC analyses in Abaqus/Standard. The UNSYMM
parameter is ignored in eigenvalue analyses (such as *BUCKLE or *FREQUENCY) since
Abaqus/Standard can perform an eigenvalue extraction only on symmetric matrices.
INC
This parameter is relevant only when the FILE parameter is used.
Set this parameter equal to the increment in the selected step of the previous analysis from which
the concentrated nodal forces will be read. By default, the concentrated nodal forces will be read
from the last increment of the step speciﬁed on the STEP parameter or from the last step if the STEP
parameter is omitted.
LOAD CASE
This parameter applies only to Abaqus/Standard analyses.
Set this parameter equal to the load case number. This parameter is used in *RANDOM RESPONSE
analysis (Random Response Analysis), when it is the cross-reference for the load case on the
*CORRELATION option. The parameter's value is ignored in all other procedures.
OP
Set OP=MOD (default) for existing *CLOADs to remain, with this option modifying existing
concentrated loads or deﬁning additional concentrated loads.
Set OP=NEW if all existing *CLOADs applied to the model should be removed. New concentrated
loads can be deﬁned.
REGION TYPE
This parameter applies only to Abaqus/Explicit analyses.
This parameter is relevant only for concentrated loads applied on the boundary of an adaptive mesh
domain. If concentrated loads are applied to nodes in the interior of an adaptive mesh domain, these
nodes will always follow the material.
Set REGION TYPE=LAGRANGIAN (default) to apply a concentrated load to a node that follows
the material (nonadaptive).
Set REGION TYPE=SLIDING to apply a concentrated load to a node that can slide over the material.
Mesh constraints are typically applied to the node to ﬁx it spatially.
Set REGION TYPE=EULERIAN to apply a concentrated load to a node that can move independently
of the material. This option is used only for boundary regions where the material can ﬂow into or
out of the adaptive mesh domain. Mesh constraints must be used normal to an Eulerian boundary
region to allow material to ﬂow through the region. If no mesh constraints are applied, an Eulerian
boundary region will behave in the same way as a sliding boundary region.
STEP
This parameter is relevant only when the FILE parameter is used.
Set this parameter equal to the step number of the previous analysis from which the concentrated
nodal forces will be read. By default, the concentrated nodal forces will be read from the last step
of the previous analysis.

parameter on the *STEP option (see Deﬁning an Analysis).

Optional, mutually exclusive parameters:

of the secondary surface that are in contact with the main surface at the beginning of a simulation.
Set COHERE=FIRST CONTACTS to establish cohesive bonds for active contact constraints at the
beginning of a simulation plus the ﬁrst time an initially not-in-contact region comes into contact
during a simulation. This parameter value is not allowed for general contact in Abaqus/Standard.
Set COHERE=REPEATED CONTACTS to allow cohesive rebonding each time contact is

the secondary surface that are in contact with the main surface at the start of a step, but also for
secondary nodes that are not initially in contact but may come in contact during the course of a step.
This setting must be used together with the REPEATED CONTACTS parameter for general contact

Required parameters:
ELSET
Set this parameter equal to the name of the element set containing the elements for which the cohesive
properties are being deﬁned.
MATERIAL
Set this parameter equal to the name of the material to be used with these elements.
RESPONSE
This parameter speciﬁes the geometric assumption that deﬁnes the constitutive behavior of the
cohesive elements.
Set RESPONSE=TRACTION SEPARATION if the response is deﬁned directly in terms of traction
and separation.
Set RESPONSE=CONTINUUM to specify that the cohesive elements model a strain state involving
one direct (opening strain) and two transverse shear components.
Set RESPONSE=GASKET to specify that the stress state in the cohesive elements is uniaxial.
When RESPONSE=CONTINUUM or GASKET, the constitutive behavior of the element must be
deﬁned in terms of continuum material properties using any available material model in Abaqus
(subject to the limitation that certain models are not available for a one-dimensional stress state).
Optional parameters:
CONTROLS
Set this parameter equal to the name of a *SECTION CONTROLS deﬁnition (see Section Controls).
The *SECTION CONTROLS option can be used to specify whether the cohesive elements should
be deleted once they completely fail. This option may also be used to specify a maximum value of
the scalar degradation (damage) parameter, D, and/or the viscosity coefﬁcient, , for viscous
regularization.
HALF
Include this parameter to enforce the symmetric modeling of cohesive elements in Abaqus/Standard.
This parameter is recommended if the cohesive elements are connected to pipe elements.
167
*COHESIVE SECTION

If cohesive elements without pore pressure degrees of freedom are used, including this parameter
is the same as including the SYMMETRIC parameter.
If cohesive elements with pore pressure degrees of freedom are used to model tangential ﬂow while
*CFLOW is used to deﬁne the ﬂuid injected into the middle plane of the cohesive elements, only
half of the ﬂow magnitude as that for a corresponding full model should be used.
ORIENTATION
Set this parameter equal to the name given for the *ORIENTATION option (Orientations) to be used
to deﬁne a local coordinate system for integration point calculations in the cohesive elements in the
speciﬁed element set.
STACK DIRECTION
Set this parameter equal to 1, 2, 3, or ORIENTATION to deﬁne the cohesive element stack or
thickness direction. Specify one of the numerical values to select the corresponding isoparametric
direction of the element as the stack or thickness direction. The default is STACK DIRECTION=3
for three-dimensional cohesive elements and STACK DIRECTION=2 for two-dimensional and
axisymmetric elements.
If STACK DIRECTION=ORIENTATION, the ORIENTATION parameter is also required.
To obtain a desired thickness direction, the appropriate numerical value for the STACK DIRECTION
parameter depends on the element connectivity. For a mesh-independent speciﬁcation, use STACK
DIRECTION=ORIENTATION.
This parameter cannot be used with pore pressure cohesive elements.
SYMMETRIC
Include this parameter to enforce the symmetric modeling of cohesive elements in Abaqus/Standard.
If cohesive elements without pore pressure degrees of freedom are used, including this parameter
is the same as including the HALF parameter.
If cohesive elements with pore pressure degrees of freedom are used to model tangential ﬂow while
*CFLOW is used to deﬁne the ﬂuid injected into the middle plane of the cohesive elements, the
same ﬂow magnitude as that for a corresponding full model should be used.
THICKNESS
Set THICKNESS=GEOMETRY if the initial constitutive thickness of the cohesive layer is determined
from the nodal coordinates of the elements.
Set THICKNESS=SPECIFIED to specify the initial constitutive thickness of the layer on the data
line below. If the data ﬁeld representing the initial constitutive thickness is left blank or set equal
to zero, a unit thickness is assumed.
The default value of this parameter depends on the choice of the RESPONSE parameter. If
RESPONSE=TRACTION SEPARATION, the default is THICKNESS=SPECIFIED. If
RESPONSE=CONTINUUM, the default is THICKNESS=GEOMETRY. If RESPONSE=GASKET,
there is no default; the THICKNESS parameter must be stated explicitly.

PROPERTY EVALUATION
Set this parameter equal to the frequency at which to evaluate frequency-dependent properties for
viscoelasticity, springs, and dashpots during complex eigenvalue extraction. If this parameter is
omitted, Abaqus/Standard will evaluate the material properties associated with frequency-dependent
springs and dashpots at zero frequency and will not consider the contributions from frequency-domain
viscoelasticity in the *COMPLEX FREQUENCY step.
STIFFNESS PROJECTION
Set STIFFNESS PROJECTION=YES (default) to project the stiffness operator on the modal

Set STIFFNESS PROJECTION=NO to skip projection of the stiffness operator on the modal

basis vectors is used as a modal stiffness operator and some advanced mechanical effects (such as
friction-induced effects, frequency-dependent properties, and other effects) are ignored. This option
can signiﬁcantly reduce the computational time in the stiffness projection phase of the analysis, but
it should be used with caution.
Set STIFFNESS PROJECTION=CONTACT ONLY if advanced mechanical properties (for example,
friction) are localized in the contact area only and the rest of the model has the same properties as

*CONCRETE: Define concrete properties beyond the elastic range.
Warning:  Success in analyzing plain and reinforced concrete problems depends signiﬁcantly on making
sensible choices regarding the concrete material parameters described in this section as well as, in the
case of reinforced concrete, the deﬁnition of rebar in the problem. It is important to be familiar with the
issues relating to concrete modeling and rebar deﬁnition by referring to Concrete Smeared Cracking,
Deﬁning Rebar as an Element Property, and the appropriate sections in the Abaqus Theory Guide and the
Abaqus Example Problems Guide.
The *CONCRETE option is used to deﬁne the properties of plain concrete outside the elastic range in an
Abaqus/Standard analysis. It must be used in conjunction with the *TENSION STIFFENING option and may
also appear with the *SHEAR RETENTION and *FAILURE RATIOS options. The properties and locations of
reinforcement bars are given separately (Deﬁning Rebar as an Element Property).
The *BRITTLE CRACKING option is used to analyze concrete in an Abaqus/Explicit analysis (see Cracking

Required parameters:
TYPE
Set TYPE=MOTION to use either connector constitutive relative motions (displacements/rotations)
or plastic relative motions (displacement/rotations) to specify damage evolution.
Set TYPE=ENERGY to use post-damage initiation dissipation energies to specify damage evolution.
Optional parameters:
AFFECTED COMPONENTS
Include this parameter to identify on the data line the components of relative motion that will be
damaged.
If this parameter is omitted and the COMPONENT parameter is included on the associated
*CONNECTOR DAMAGE INITIATION option, only the speciﬁed component will undergo damage.
If both this parameter and the COMPONENT parameter on the associated *CONNECTOR DAMAGE
INITIATION option are omitted, only the components of relative motion involved in the associated
*CONNECTOR POTENTIAL deﬁnition will undergo damage.
DEGRADATION
Set DEGRADATION=MAXIMUM (default) to indicate that the damage value associated with this
option will be ﬁrst compared to damage values from other damage mechanisms (if deﬁned) and
that only the maximum value will be considered for the overall damage.
Set DEGRADATION=MULTIPLICATIVE to indicate that the damage value associated with this
option will contribute multiplicatively to the overall damage.
DEPENDENCIES
Set this parameter equal to the number of ﬁeld variable dependencies included in the deﬁnition of
the connector damage evolution, in addition to temperature. If this parameter is omitted, it is assumed
199

that the connector damage evolution is independent of ﬁeld variables. See Material Data Deﬁnition
for more information.

EXTRAPOLATION=LINEAR is used) to use constant extrapolation of the dependent variables
outside the speciﬁed range of the independent variables.

*CONNECTOR LOCK

*CONNECTOR MOTION: Specify the motion of available components of
relative motion in connector elements.
This option is used to prescribe the motion of available components of relative motion in connector elements.
Products: Abaqus/Standard Abaqus/Explicit Abaqus/CAE
Type:  Model or history data
Level: Model,  Step
Abaqus/CAE:  Load module
References:
• Connection Types
• DISP
Optional parameters (history data only):
AMPLITUDE
This parameter is relevant only when some of the variables being prescribed have nonzero magnitudes.
Set this parameter equal to the name of the amplitude curve deﬁning the magnitude of the prescribed
connector motions (Amplitude Curves).
If this parameter is omitted in an Abaqus/Standard analysis, either the reference magnitude is applied
linearly over the step (a RAMP function) or it is applied immediately at the beginning of the step
and subsequently held constant (a STEP function). The choice of RAMP or STEP function depends
on the value assigned to the AMPLITUDE parameter on the *STEP option (Deﬁning an Analysis).
Two exceptions are displacement or rotation components given with TYPE=DISPLACEMENT,
for which the default is always a RAMP function, and displacement or rotation components in a
static step given with TYPE=VELOCITY, for which the default is always a STEP function.
If this parameter is omitted in an Abaqus/Explicit analysis, the reference magnitude is applied
immediately at the beginning of the step and subsequently held constant (a STEP function).
In an Abaqus/Standard dynamic procedure, amplitude curves speciﬁed for TYPE=DISPLACEMENT
or TYPE=VELOCITY will be smoothed automatically. In an explicit dynamic analysis using
Abaqus/Explicit, the user must request that such amplitude curves are smoothed. For more
information, see Amplitude Curves.
LOAD CASE
This parameter applies only to Abaqus/Standard analyses.
This parameter is ignored in all procedures except *BUCKLE. The parameter can be set equal to 1
(default) or 2.
LOAD CASE=1 can be used to deﬁne the connector motion for the applied loads and LOAD
CASE=2 can be used to deﬁne antisymmetry connector motion for the buckling modes.
OP
Set OP=MOD (default) to modify existing connector motions or to add connector motions to available
components of relative motion that were previously unconstrained.
Set OP=NEW if all connector motions that are currently in effect should be removed. To remove
only selected connector motions, use OP=NEW and respecify all connector motions that are to be
retained.
Abaqus Keywords Guide
238
*CONNECTOR MOTION

If a connector motion is removed in a stress/displacement analysis, it will be replaced by a
concentrated force equal to the reaction force calculated at the restrained degree of freedom at the
end of the previous step. If the step is a general nonlinear analysis step, this concentrated force will
then be removed according to the AMPLITUDE parameter on the *STEP option. Therefore, by
default the concentrated force will be reduced linearly to zero over the period of the step in a static
analysis and immediately in a dynamic analysis.
Optional, mutually exclusive parameters (history data only):
FIXED
Include this parameter to indicate that the values of the variables being prescribed with this
*CONNECTOR MOTION option should remain ﬁxed at their current values at the start of the step.
If this parameter is used, any magnitudes given on the data lines are ignored.
TYPE
This parameter is used in a stress/displacement analysis to specify whether the magnitude is in the
form of a displacement history, a velocity history, or an acceleration history.
Set TYPE=DISPLACEMENT (default) to give a displacement history.
Set TYPE=VELOCITY to give a velocity history. Velocity histories can be speciﬁed in static
analyses. In this case the default variation is STEP.
Set TYPE=ACCELERATION to give an acceleration history. Acceleration histories should not be
used in static analysis steps.
USER
This parameter applies only to Abaqus/Standard analyses.
Include this parameter to indicate that any nonzero magnitudes associated with variables prescribed
through this option will be deﬁned in user subroutine DISP. If this parameter is used, any magnitudes
deﬁned by the data lines of the option (and possibly modiﬁed by the AMPLITUDE parameter) can
be redeﬁned in subroutine DISP. The value of the TYPE parameter is ignored when this option is
used.
Optional, mutually exclusive parameters for matrix generation and direct-solution steady-state
dynamics analysis (history data only):
IMAGINARY
Include this parameter to deﬁne the imaginary (out-of-phase) part of the connector motion.
REAL
Include this parameter (default) to deﬁne the real (in-phase) part of the connector motion.
Data lines to prescribe connector motion:
First line:
1. Connector element number or element set label.
2. Available component of relative motion number for which the motion is speciﬁed. See Connection
Types for deﬁnitions of the available components of relative motion.
The following data item is necessary only when nonzero connector motion is speciﬁed as history
data. Any magnitude given will be ignored when the connector motion is given as model data.
3. Actual magnitude of the variable (displacement, velocity, or acceleration). This magnitude will
be modiﬁed by an amplitude speciﬁcation if the AMPLITUDE parameter is used. If this
magnitude is a rotation, it must be given in radians. The magnitude can be redeﬁned in user
subroutine DISP if the USER parameter is included.

*CONSTRAINT CONTROLS: Reset overconstraint checking controls.
Warning:  Use this option to specify the technique to be used to enforce constraints associated with
connector elements. Otherwise, this option should not be used unless the user is certain that the model is
free of overconstraints. An overconstraint means applying multiple consistent or inconsistent kinematic
constraints. Many models have nodal degrees of freedom that are overconstrained, and such overconstraints
may lead to inaccurate solutions or nonconvergence. By default, the model will be checked for
overconstraints. The consistent overconstraints will be removed whenever possible, while an error message
is issued if an inconsistent overconstraint is detected.

Required parameters:
NAME
Set this parameter equal to a label that will be used to refer to this contact clearance property.
Optional parameters:
ADJUST
Set ADJUST=YES (default) to resolve clearances by adjusting the nodal coordinates without creating
strain in the model. ADJUST=YES can be used only for clearances deﬁned in the ﬁrst step of an
analysis.
Set ADJUST=NO to store contact offsets so that the clearances can be satisﬁed without adjusting
the nodal coordinates.
CLEARANCE
Set this parameter equal to the value of the initial clearance for the entire set of secondary nodes or

non-negative for secondary nodes on solid element surfaces. The default value is 0.0.
SEARCH ABOVE

to be included in the clearance speciﬁcation. The default for solid elements is approximately one-tenth
of the element size of the elements attached to a secondary node. The default for structural elements
(e.g., shell elements) is the thickness associated with the secondary node.

*CONTACT CONTROLS: Specify additional controls for contact.
This option is used to provide additional optional solution controls for contact pairs in Abaqus/Standard and

solutions for models involving complicated geometries and numerous contact interfaces, as well as for models
in which rigid body motions are initially not constrained.

Specifying additional controls for contact in an Abaqus/Standard analysis
Optional, mutually exclusive parameters applicable to augmented Lagrangian constraint
enforcement:
ABSOLUTE PENETRATION TOLERANCE
Set this parameter equal to the allowable penetration. Only contact constraints deﬁned with augmented
Lagrangian surface behavior will be affected by this parameter.
RELATIVE PENETRATION TOLERANCE
Set this parameter equal to the ratio of the allowable penetration to the characteristic contact surface
face dimension. Only contact constraints deﬁned with augmented Lagrangian surface behavior will
be affected by this parameter. By default, the RELATIVE PENETRATION TOLERANCE parameter
is set to 0.1% except for ﬁnite-sliding, surface-to-surface contact, in which case the default setting
is 5%.
Optional parameters:
MAIN
Set this parameter equal to the main surface name to apply the controls to a speciﬁc contact pair.
This parameter must be used in conjunction with the SECONDARY parameter to specify a contact
pair.
PERTURBATION TANGENT SCALE FACTOR
257
*CONTACT CONTROLS

Set this parameter equal to the factor by which Abaqus/Standard will scale the default tangential
stiffness used for the contact pairs in a particular linear perturbation step. Only contact constraints
enforced with penalty methods will be affected by this parameter. This tangential scale factor is
activated when a nonzero friction is speciﬁed on the data line of the *FRICTION option.
PRESSURE DEPENDENT PERTURBATION
Set this parameter equal to the value of the 
 coefﬁcient controlling the base state contact
pressure–dependent enforcement of contact constraints in a particular linear perturbation step. This
parameter allows you to relax or remove both normal and tangential contact constraints with low
pressure.
RESET
Include this parameter to reset all contact controls to their default values. This parameter cannot be
used with any other parameters, except for the SECONDARY and MAIN parameters. When this
parameter is used in conjunction with the SECONDARY and MAIN parameters, the controls applied
to the speciﬁc contact pair are removed.
SECONDARY
Set this parameter equal to the secondary surface name to apply the controls to a speciﬁc contact
pair. This parameter must be used in conjunction with the MAIN parameter to specify a contact
pair.
STABILIZE
Include this parameter to address situations where rigid body modes exist as long as contact is not
fully established. This parameter activates damping in the normal and tangential directions based
on the stiffness of the underlying mesh and the time step size. If no value is assigned to this parameter,
Abaqus calculates the damping coefﬁcient automatically. If a numerical value is assigned to this
parameter, Abaqus multiplies the automatically calculated damping coefﬁcient by this value. If the
damping coefﬁcient is deﬁned directly on the data line, any numerical value assigned to this parameter
is ignored.
Set STABILIZE =USER ADAPTIVE to scale the automatically calculated damping coefﬁcient or
the damping coefﬁcient speciﬁed on the data line by a factor that decreases over iterations within
one increment, according to the pattern speciﬁed on the second data line.
The STABILIZE parameter can be used to specify damping for the whole model or for an individual
contact pair by using the SECONDARY and MAIN parameters. Values speciﬁed for a speciﬁc
contact pair override the values for the whole model, if given.
STIFFNESS SCALE FACTOR
Set this parameter equal to the factor by which Abaqus/Standard will scale the default penalty
stiffness to obtain the stiffnesses used for the contact pairs.
Set STIFFNESS SCALE FACTOR=USER ADAPTIVE to scale the default penalty stiffness by a
factor that increases over iterations of the ﬁrst increment and remains constant (equal to the last
speciﬁed value) for subsequent increments.
This scale factor acts as an additional multiplier on any scale factor speciﬁed on the data line of the
*SURFACE BEHAVIOR option.
TANGENT FRACTION
Set this parameter equal to a fraction of the damping in the normal direction as speciﬁed with the
STABILIZE parameter. By default, the tangential and normal stabilization are the same.

*CONTACT CONTROLS

Optional data line if the PRESSURE DEPENDENT PERTURBATION parameter is included:
First (and only) line:
1. The 
 coefﬁcient. Default is equal to 
.
Optional data lines if the STABILIZE parameter is included:
First line:
1. Damping coefﬁcient to be used in the contact interface. The value entered overrides the damping
coefﬁcient calculated by Abaqus.
2. Fraction of the damping that remains at the end of the step. The default is zero. Set to one to
keep the damping constant over the step. If a nonzero value is speciﬁed, convergence problems
may occur in a subsequent step if stabilization is not used in that step.
3. Clearance at which the damping becomes zero. By default, the clearance is calculated by Abaqus
based on the facet size associated with the contact pair. Set to a large value to obtain damping
independent of the opening distance.
Second line (required if STABILIZE=USER ADAPTIVE):
1. Up to eight values in descending order. For example, 1.0, 0.0.
For STABILIZE without the USER ADAPTIVE setting, omitting the ﬁrst data line can have different effects
than specifying a blank data line. A blank data line causes parameters of the data line to be set to default values;
whereas prior values of these parameters will persist if the data line is omitted and RESET is not in effect.
Optional data line if STIFFNESS SCALE FACTOR=USER ADAPTIVE:
Third line if STABILIZE=USER ADAPTIVE; otherwise, first line:
1. Up to eight scale values in ascending order. By default, the stiffness scale factors are

Warning: These controls are intended for experienced analysts and should be used with care. Using
nondefault values of these controls may greatly increase the computational time of the analysis or produce
inaccurate results.
Required parameters:
CPSET
Set this parameter equal to the name of the contact pair set associated with this contact controls
deﬁnition. The contact controls deﬁned with this option will be applied to all contact pairs having
this contact pair set name.
Optional parameters:
FASTLOCALTRK
Set FASTLOCALTRK=NO if contact is not being enforced appropriately. A more conservative
local tracking method will be used that may resolve the error. The default is FASTLOCALTRK=YES,
which uses a more computationally efﬁcient local tracking method.

*CONTACT CONTROLS

Set this parameter equal to the maximum number of increments between global contact searches.
The default is 100 increments for two-surface contact and 4 increments for self-contact.
RESET
Include this parameter to reset all of the optional controls to their default values. Those controls that
are explicitly speciﬁed with other parameters on the same *CONTACT CONTROLS option are not
reset. If this parameter is omitted, only the explicitly speciﬁed controls will be changed in the current
step; the others will remain at their previous settings.
SCALE PENALTY
Set this parameter equal to the factor by which Abaqus/Explicit will scale the default penalty
stiffnesses to obtain the stiffnesses used for the penalty contact pairs within the contact pair set
speciﬁed with the CPSET parameter. Penalty contact constraints deﬁned with softened surface
behavior and kinematic contact constraints is not affected by this parameter. By default, the SCALE
PENALTY parameter is set to unity.
WARP CHECK PERIOD
Set this parameter equal to the number of increments between checks for highly warped facets on
main surfaces. By default, this check is performed every 20 increments. More frequent checks will
cause a slight increase in computational time.
WARP CUT OFF
Set this parameter equal to the out-of-plane warping angle, measured in degrees, at which a facet
will be considered to be highly warped. The out-of-plane warping angle is deﬁned as the amount
of variation of the surface normal over a facet. The default is WARP CUT OFF=20.

Optional, mutually exclusive parameters:
INITIAL CLEARANCE
Set this parameter equal to a positive value to specify an initial clearance distance.

initial clearance distance. The named clearance deﬁnition can be used for general contact interactions
in portions of the model where the small-sliding tracking approach is active or for interactions in
heat transfer and coupled electrical-thermal procedures that have no mechanical degrees of freedom.
For interactions with the ﬁnite-sliding tracking approach, the clearance deﬁnition is ignored.

and coupled electrical-thermal procedures that have no mechanical degrees of freedom. The setting
is ignored when the INTERFERENCE FIT parameter or the INITIAL CLEARANCE parameter
with a value is speciﬁed.
MINIMUM DISTANCE
This parameter applies only to Abaqus/Standard analyses.
Set MINIMUM DISTANCE=YES (default) to automatically activate localized contact damping
when nearby surfaces are touching at only a single point.

Set this parameter equal to the name of the node set containing the secondary nodes to be included
in the initial clearance speciﬁcation. The speciﬁed clearance is enforced at all secondary nodes in
this node set irrespective of whether they are above or below their respective main surfaces. This
parameter can also be used to identify initially bonded nodes in a VCCT analysis.

Defining contacting surfaces in an Abaqus/Standard analysis
Required parameters:
INTERACTION
Set this parameter equal to the name of the *SURFACE INTERACTION property deﬁnition associated
with the contact pair being deﬁned.
Optional parameters:
ADJUST
Set this parameter equal to a node set label or a value to adjust the initial positions of the surfaces
speciﬁed in this option. These adjustments are made at the start of the analysis and do not create
any strain.
Set ADJUST=YES and use the POSITION TOLERANCE parameter to adjust the initial positions
of the surfaces speciﬁed in this option. These adjustments are made at the start of the analysis and
do not create any strain.
Alternatively, for SMALL SLIDING contact or TIED contact, set ADJUST=NO and use the
POSITION TOLERANCE parameter to control which secondary nodes are considered initially in
contact or tied. In these cases, initial positions of the surfaces are not adjusted, and offset distances
are considered for penetration calculations of the respective secondary nodes such that the initial
penetration is zero.

*CONTACT PAIR

This parameter is required for TIED contact.
If this parameter is omitted, overclosures are treated as interference ﬁts.
EXTENSION ZONE
Set this parameter equal to a fraction of the end segment or facet edge length by which the main
surface is to be extended to avoid numerical roundoff errors associated with contact modeling. The
value given must lie between 0.0 and 0.2. The default is 0.1. This parameter affects only
node-to-surface contact.
GEOMETRIC CORRECTION
Set this parameter equal to the name of the surface smoothing property deﬁned by *SURFACE
SMOOTHING. This parameter affects only surface-to-surface contact.
HCRIT
Set this parameter equal to the distance by which a point on the secondary surface must penetrate
the main surface before Abaqus/Standard abandons the current increment and tries again with a
smaller increment. The default value of HCRIT is half of the length of a characteristic element face
on the secondary surface. This parameter does not apply to contact pairs that use the ﬁnite-sliding,
surface-to-surface contact formulation.
MIDFACE NODES
Set MIDFACE NODES=YES to automatically convert most three-dimensional second-order element
types with no midface node (serendipity elements) that form a secondary surface of a
surface-to-surface contact pair into elements with a midface node.
Set MIDFACE NODES=NO (default) to avoid adding midface nodes to elements underlying the
secondary surface of a surface-to-surface contact pair.
This parameter can be used only with surface-to-surface contact pairs. Abaqus/Standard automatically
converts most serendipity elements that form a secondary surface of a node-to-surface contact pair
into elements with a midface node.
MINIMUM DISTANCE
Set MINIMUM DISTANCE=YES (default) to automatically activate localized contact damping
when nearby surfaces are initially touching at only a single point.
Set MINIMUM DISTANCE=NO to forgo this automatic localized damping.
This parameter can be used only with the ﬁnite-sliding, surface-to-surface contact formulation.
NO THICKNESS
Include this parameter to ignore surface thickness effects in the contact calculations. This parameter
affects only contact formulations that account for surface thickness by default (it does not affect
ﬁnite-sliding, node-to-surface contact).
POSITION TOLERANCE
This parameter is applicable only if ADJUST=YES or ADJUST=NO.
Set this parameter equal to the upper bound of the initial gap distance for which secondary nodes
are to be adjusted if ADJUST=YES. If this parameter is omitted, Abaqus/Standard adjusts only
those secondary nodes that are penetrating the main surface.
Set this parameter equal to the upper bound of the initial gap distance for which secondary nodes
are considered initially in contact or tied if ADJUST=NO. Initial positions of these secondary nodes
are not adjusted automatically. Instead, offset distances for use in penetration calculations for these
nodes are generated internally such that the initial penetration is zero with consideration of the offset
distance. These offsets remain in effect throughout the simulation.

SMALL SLIDING
Include this parameter to indicate that the small-sliding contact formulation, rather than the
ﬁnite-sliding contact formulation, should be used. This parameter is not allowed with self-contact.
SMOOTH
Set this parameter equal to the degree of smoothing used for element-based main surfaces in the
ﬁnite-sliding, node-to-surface contact formulation. The value given must lie between 0.0 and 0.5.
The default is 0.2. This parameter does not affect contact pairs with analytical rigid surfaces or
contact formulations other than the ﬁnite-sliding, node-to-surface contact formulation.
SLIDING TRANSITION
Set SLIDING TRANSITION=ELEMENT ORDER SMOOTHING to have smoothing of the nodal
force redistribution upon sliding be of the same order as the elements underlying the secondary
surface.
Set SLIDING TRANSITION=LINEAR SMOOTHING to have linear smoothing of the nodal force
redistribution upon sliding.
Set SLIDING TRANSITION=QUADRATIC SMOOTHING to have quadratic smoothing of the
nodal force redistribution upon sliding.
This parameter can be used only with the surface-to-surface contact formulation.
SUPPLEMENTARY CONSTRAINTS
Set SUPPLEMENTARY CONSTRAINTS=SELECTIVE (default) to use a selective scheme of
supplementary constraints.
Set SUPPLEMENTARY CONSTRAINTS=YES to add the supplementary contact constraints when
applicable.
Set SUPPLEMENTARY CONSTRAINTS=NO to forgo the supplementary contact constraints.
TIED
Include this parameter to indicate that the surfaces of this *CONTACT PAIR are to be “tied” together
for the duration of the simulation. The ADJUST parameter is required when the TIED parameter is
used. This parameter is not allowed with self-contact.
TRACKING
This parameter controls which contact tracking algorithm is used for ﬁnite-sliding, surface-to-surface
contact; it has no effect on contact pairs that use other formulations.
Set TRACKING=PATH (default) to invoke a path-based contact tracking algorithm for ﬁnite-sliding,
surface-to-surface contact.
Set TRACKING=STATE to invoke a state-based contact tracking algorithm for ﬁnite-sliding,
surface-to-surface contact.
TYPE
Set TYPE=NODE TO SURFACE (default) to have the contact constraint coefﬁcients generated
according to the interpolation functions at the point where the secondary node projects onto the
main surface.
Set TYPE=SURFACE TO SURFACE to have the contact constraint coefﬁcients generated such
that stress accuracy is optimized for the speciﬁed surface type pairings. This parameter setting will

*CONTOUR INTEGRAL: Provide contour integral estimates.
Warning:  Contour integrals are not calculated accurately for the bending stress in shells. If contour
integral values are needed where the bending stress is signiﬁcant, use second-order solid elements (C3D20
or C3D27) in the crack-tip region where the integral is evaluated instead of shell elements. Contour
integrals should not be requested in a linear perturbation step.
The *CONTOUR INTEGRAL option offers the evaluation of the J-integral, the 
-integral, the stress intensity
factors, and the T-stress for fracture mechanics studies based on either the conventional ﬁnite element method
or the extended ﬁnite element method (XFEM). The option also computes the crack propagation direction at
initiation when the stress intensity factors are evaluated. Contour integrals along several different crack fronts
can be evaluated by repeating this option as often as needed in the step deﬁnition.

ELSET
Set this parameter equal to the name of the element set containing all elements inside the contour

last increment of each step unless FREQUENCY=0. The default is FREQUENCY=1. Set
FREQUENCY=0 to suppress the output.

Include this parameter to indicate that no adjustments will be made with both the locations and the
radii of all nodes along the crack front for the line integral evaluations.

This parameter is relevant only when tetrahedral elements are used for fracture mechanics studies
based on the conventional ﬁnite element method.
Set this parameter equal to a small radius from the crack tip within which rings of elements are used
for fracture mechanics studies. The default value of the ring radius is twice the typical element
characteristic length of those elements along the crack front. The default value works well for most

not stored in the results (.fil) ﬁle.
Set OUTPUT=FILE to store the contour integral values in the results ﬁle.
Set OUTPUT=BOTH to print the contour integral values in the data ﬁle and to store them in the

RESIDUAL STRESS STEP
Use this parameter to account for the effect of residual stress gradients on the contour integral
evaluation. Set this parameter equal to the step number from which the stress data in the last available
increment of the speciﬁed step will be considered as residual stresses. The default is 0, in which
case the residual stresses are deﬁned by the speciﬁed initial conditions.

Optional parameters:
ADVECTION
This parameter applies only to a coupled thermal-electrochemical-structural–pore pressure analysis.
It is valid only when pore pressure is included with electrochemistry and adds an advection
contribution (resulting from the velocity ﬁeld of the electrolyte) to the ion ﬂux equation.
Set ADVECTION=YES (default) to consider the ﬂuid velocity effects.
Set ADVECTION=NO to ignore the ﬂuid velocity effects.
ALLSDTOL
Include this parameter to indicate that an adaptive automatic damping algorithm will be activated
in this step. Set this parameter equal to the maximum allowable ratio of the stabilization energy to
the total strain energy. The initial damping factor is speciﬁed using the STABILIZE parameter or
the FACTOR parameter. This damping factor will then be adjusted through the step based on the
convergence history and the value of ALLSDTOL. If this parameter is set equal to zero, the adaptive
automatic damping algorithm is not activated; a constant damping factor will be used throughout
the step. If this parameter is included without a speciﬁed value, the default value is 0.05. If this
parameter is omitted but the STABILIZE parameter is included with the default value of dissipated
energy fraction, the adaptive automatic damping algorithm will be activated automatically with
ALLSDTOL=0.05.
This parameter must be used in conjunction with the STABILIZE parameter (see Solving Nonlinear
Problems).
AMBIENT ION CONCENTRATION
This parameter applies only to a coupled thermal-electrochemical-structural–pore pressure analysis.
It is valid only when pore pressure is included with electrochemistry and the ﬂuid velocity effects
are modeled using ADVECTION=YES.
This parameter is used to model the presence of an external reservoir of electrolyte at a prescribed
ion concentration.
Abaqus Keywords Guide
310
*COUPLED TEMPERATURE-DISPLACEMENT

Set AMBIENT ION CONCENTRATION=
 to prescribe the ion concentration of the external
electrolyte reservoir.
CONTINUE
Set CONTINUE=NO (default) to specify that this step will not carry over the damping factors from
the results of the preceding general step. In this case the initial damping factors will be recalculated
based on the declared damping intensity and on the solution of the ﬁrst increment of the step or can
be speciﬁed directly.
Set CONTINUE=YES to specify that this step will carry over the damping factors from the end of
the immediately preceding general step.
This parameter must be used in conjunction with the ALLSDTOL and the STABILIZE parameters.
CREEP
Set CREEP=EXPLICIT to use explicit integration for creep and swelling effects throughout the
step, which might sometimes be computationally less expensive. When CREEP=EXPLICIT, the
time increment will be limited by the accuracy tolerances (CETOL and DELTMX) and also by the
stability limit of the forward difference operator. See Rate-Dependent Plasticity: Creep and Swelling
for details on the integration scheme.
Set CREEP=NONE to specify that there is no creep or viscoelastic response occurring during this
step even if creep or viscoelastic material properties have been deﬁned.
ELECTRICAL
Include this parameter to model electrical conduction in regions of the model that use
thermal-electrical-structural elements.
In this case, Abaqus/Standard solves the heat transfer equations in conjunction with the mechanical
equilibrium and the electrical conduction equations.
Omit this parameter to specify that electrical conduction is not modeled in these regions.
ELECTROCHEMICAL
Include this parameter to model electrochemistry in regions of the model that use
thermal-electrochemical-structural elements.
In this case, Abaqus/Standard solves the heat transfer equations in conjunction with the mechanical
equilibrium and the electrical and electrochemical equations.
Omit this parameter to specify that electrochemistry is not modeled in these regions.
FACTOR
Set this parameter equal to the damping factor to be used in the automatic damping algorithm (see
Solving Nonlinear Problems) if the problem is expected to be unstable due to local instabilities and
the damping factor calculated by Abaqus/Standard is not suitable. This parameter must be used in
conjunction with the STABILIZE parameter and overrides the automatic calculation of the damping
factor based on a value of the dissipated energy fraction.
PORE PRESSURE
Include this parameter to model pore pressure–mediated ﬂuid (electrolyte) ﬂow in a porous medium
along with the thermal, electrochemical, and structural physics in regions of the model that use
thermal-electrochemical-structural–pore pressure elements.
In this case, Abaqus/Standard solves the pore ﬂuid continuity equation fully coupled with the thermal,
electrochemical, and structural governing equations.
Omit this parameter if pore ﬂuid continuity is not modeled in these regions.

RATE DEPENDENCE
Set RATE DEPENDENCE=ON (default) to consider the strain rate–dependence when evaluating
the yield stress of a material and to consider the slip rate–dependence when evaluating the friction
coefﬁcient.
Set RATE DEPENDENCE=OFF to ignore the strain rate–dependence when evaluating the yield
stress of a material and to ignore the slip rate–dependence when evaluating the friction coefﬁcient.
STABILIZE
Include this parameter to use automatic stabilization if the problem is expected to be unstable due
to local instabilities. Set this parameter equal to the dissipated energy fraction of the automatic
damping algorithm (see Solving Nonlinear Problems). If this parameter is omitted, the stabilization
algorithm is not activated. If this parameter is included without a speciﬁed value, the default value
of the dissipated energy fraction is 2 × 10−4 and the adaptive automatic damping algorithm will be
activated by default with ALLSDTOL =0.05 in this step; set ALLSDTOL=0 to deactivate the
adaptive automatic damping algorithm. If the FACTOR parameter is used, any value of the dissipated
energy fraction is overridden by the damping factor.
STEADY STATE
Include this parameter to choose steady-state analysis. If this parameter is omitted, the step is assumed
to involve transient response. If this parameter is included, automatic time incrementation will be
used.
Optional parameters to control time incrementation in transient analysis:
CETOL
This parameter is meaningful only when the material response is time dependent (creep and swelling).
Set this parameter equal to the maximum difference in the creep strain increment calculated from
the creep strain rates at the beginning and at the end of the increment, thus controlling the accuracy
of the creep integration. The tolerance is sometimes calculated by choosing an acceptable stress
error tolerance and dividing by a typical elastic modulus.
If both this parameter and the DELTMX parameter are omitted in a transient analysis, ﬁxed time
increments are used, with a constant time increment equal to the initial time increment.
DELTMX
Set this parameter equal to the maximum temperature change allowed within an increment.
Abaqus/Standard restricts the time step to ensure that this value is not exceeded at any node during
any increment of the step.
If the maximum allowable temperature change is not speciﬁed, there is no restriction on the maximum
temperature change in an increment.
POREPTOL
This parameter is valid only in a coupled thermal-electrochemical-structural–pore pressure analysis.
Set this parameter equal to the maximum pore pressure change allowed in an increment.
Abaqus/Standard restricts the time step to ensure that this value is not exceeded at any node during

Abaqus/Standard will restrict the time step to ensure that this value will not be exceeded at any node

END
Set END=PERIOD (default) to analyze a speciﬁc time period in a transient analysis. Set END=SS

MXDEM
For problems including cavity radiation heat transfer, set this parameter equal to the maximum

of MXDEM is exceeded, Abaqus/Standard will cut back the increment until the maximum change
in emissivity is less than the value input. If this parameter is omitted, a default value of 0.1 is used.
This parameter controls the accuracy of changes in emissivity due to temperature since
Abaqus/Standard evaluates the emissivity based on the temperature at the start of each increment

*CRUSHABLE FOAM HARDENING

*CRUSH STRESS: Define the crush stress of a material.
Warning:  Crush stress is not a true material property. Where the analysis laminate deviates from the
original tested laminate, the ply-by-ply data reduction process is not guaranteed to reliably predict the
crush performance on the new laminate. Where crush performance is important to the function of the
structure and deviation from the tested laminate is signiﬁcant, the resulting laminate should be tested to
conﬁrm that the crush performance follows the ply-by-ply data reduction values.
Note: All crush stresses should be measured on the complete laminated composite. Data entry is reduced
to a ply-by-ply bases, so it is possible to assess the effects of modifying layers within the analysis deﬁnition
as the structure is developed.
This option is used to deﬁne the crush stress of a material. It must be used as a suboption of the *MATERIAL
option. The crush stress can be constant (isotropic) or orientation dependent (anisotropic), deﬁned as a function
of the incidence angle. A regularization scheme is used for the material data when the crush stress is dependent.
If speciﬁed, temperature and ﬁeld dependency is evaluated only at the beginning of the analysis. Subsequent
changes in temperature and/or predeﬁned ﬁeld variables will have no effect in the crushing behavior of the
material.

The option is used, if necessary, to deﬁne how the approach velocity at a crushing interface inﬂuences a material's

If you use the *CYCLIC HARDENING option multiple times to specify test data at different equivalent
plastic strain rates, you can use the EXTRAPOLATION parameter only one time, when you specify
data at a zero equivalent plastic strain rate (*CYCLIC HARDENING, RATE=0.0). On the subsequent
343

options, you must either omit the EXTRAPOLATION parameter or specify the same method as
that used at a zero equivalent plastic strain rate.

*D ADDED MASS

*DAMAGE EVOLUTION: Specify material properties to define the evolution
of damage.
This option is used to provide material properties that deﬁne the evolution of damage leading to eventual failure.
It must be used in conjunction with the *DAMAGE INITIATION option. It can be utilized for materials deﬁned
for cohesive elements, for enriched elements, for elements with plane stress formulations (plane stress, shell,
continuum shell, and membrane elements) used with the damage model for ﬁber-reinforced materials, for ductile
bulk materials associated with any element type in a low-cycle fatigue analysis, and, in Abaqus/Explicit, for
elastic-plastic materials associated with any element type. It can also be used in conjunction with the *SURFACE
INTERACTION and *DAMAGE INITIATION options to deﬁne a contact property model that allows modeling
of progressive failure for cohesive surfaces.

• Modeling Discontinuities as an Enriched Feature Using the Extended Finite Element Method
Required parameters:
TYPE
Set TYPE=DISCONTINUOUS to deﬁne the residual stiffness scaling factor after the initiation of
damage.
Set TYPE=DISPLACEMENT to deﬁne the evolution of damage as a function of the total (for elastic
materials in cohesive elements) or the plastic (for bulk elastic-plastic materials) displacement after
the initiation of damage.
Set TYPE=ENERGY to deﬁne the evolution of damage in terms of the energy required for failure
(fracture energy) after the initiation of damage.
Set TYPE=HYSTERESIS ENERGY to deﬁne the evolution of damage in terms of the inelastic
hysteresis energy density dissipated per stabilized cycle after the initiation of damage in a low-cycle
fatigue analysis.
Optional parameters:
DEGRADATION
Set DEGRADATION=MAXIMUM (default) to specify that the current damage evolution mechanism
will interact with other damage evolution mechanisms in a maximum sense to determine the total
damage from multiple mechanisms.
349
*DAMAGE EVOLUTION

Set DEGRADATION=MULTIPLICATIVE to specify that the current damage evolution mechanism
will interact with other damage evolution mechanisms using the same value of the DEGRADATION
parameter in a multiplicative manner to determine the total damage from multiple mechanisms.
This parameter is relevant only for cohesive elements.
DEPENDENCIES
Set this parameter equal to the number of ﬁeld variables included in the deﬁnition of damage
evolution. If this parameter is omitted, it is assumed that properties deﬁning the evolution of damage
are constant or depend only on temperature. See Material Data Deﬁnition for more information.
FAILURE INDEX
This parameter can be used only in conjunction with the user-deﬁned or the LARC05 damage
initiation criterion.
Set this parameter equal to the corresponding failure mechanism speciﬁed in the user-deﬁned or
the LARC05 damage initiation criterion for enriched elements.
MIXED MODE BEHAVIOR
This parameter is meaningful only when the *DAMAGE EVOLUTION option is used to deﬁne the
evolution of damage for materials associated with cohesive elements or for surface-based cohesive
behavior. If this parameter is omitted, Abaqus assumes that the damage evolution behavior is mode
independent.
Set MIXED MODE BEHAVIOR=TABULAR to specify the fracture energy or displacement (total
or plastic) directly as a function of the shear-normal mode mix for cohesive elements. This method
must be used to specify the mixed-mode behavior for cohesive elements when
TYPE=DISPLACEMENT. This option can be used with any choice for the MODE MIX RATIO
parameter.
Set MIXED MODE BEHAVIOR=POWER LAW to specify the fracture energy as a function of the
mode mix by means of a power law mixed mode fracture criterion. This option must be used in
conjunction with either the MODE MIX RATIO=ACCUMULATED ENERGY option or the MODE
MIX RATIO=ENERGY option.
Set MIXED MODE BEHAVIOR=BK to specify the fracture energy as a function of the mode mix
by means of the Benzeggagh-Kenane mixed mode fracture criterion. This option must be used in
conjunction with either the MODE MIX RATIO=ACCUMULATED ENERGY option or the MODE
MIX RATIO=ENERGY option.
MODE MIX RATIO
This parameter can be used only in conjunction with the MIXED MODE BEHAVIOR parameter.
The speciﬁcation of the damage evolution properties (fracture energy or effective displacement) as
a function of the mode mix depends on the value of this parameter. See Deﬁning Damage Evolution
Data as a Tabular Function of Mode Mix or Deﬁning Damage Evolution Data as a Tabular Function
of Mode Mix for further details.
Set MODE MIX RATIO=ENERGY (default for all element-based, surface-based, and XFEM-based
cohesive traction-separation behaviors) to deﬁne the mode mix in terms of a ratio of fracture energy
in the different modes. The fracture energy is computed based on the current state of deformation
only, not the deformation history. Either this option or the MODE MIX RATIO=ACCUMULATED
ENERGY option must be used when MIXED MODE BEHAVIOR=POWER LAW or MIXED
MODE BEHAVIOR=BK.
Set MODE MIX RATIO=ACCUMULATED ENERGY (default for surface-based cohesive behavior
in Abaqus/Explicit) to deﬁne the mode mix in terms of a ratio of fracture energy in the different
modes. The fracture energy is computed based on the energy accumulated over the entire deformation
history at an integration point. Either this option or the MODE MIX RATIO=ENERGY option must

350
*DAMAGE EVOLUTION

be used when MIXED MODE BEHAVIOR=POWER LAW or MIXED MODE BEHAVIOR=BK.
This option is not available for surface-based cohesive behavior in Abaqus/Explicit.
Set MODE MIX RATIO=TRACTION to deﬁne the mode mix in terms of a ratio of traction
components.
POWER
This parameter can be used only in conjunction with MIXED MODE BEHAVIOR=POWER LAW
or MIXED MODE BEHAVIOR=BK.
Set this parameter equal to the exponent in the power law or the Benzeggagh-Kenane criterion that
deﬁnes the variation of fracture energy with mode mix for cohesive elements.
RATE DEPENDENT
This parameter can be used only in conjunction with the *DAMAGE INITIATION option used with
CRITERION=MAXE, CRITERION=MAXS, CRITERION=QUADE, or CRITERION=QUADS
for either cohesive elements with traction separation behavior or cohesive contact in Abaqus/Explicit.
Include this parameter to deﬁne the damage evolution criterion as a function of the effective rate of
separation.
REF ENERGY
This parameter can be used only in conjunction with TYPE=HYSTERESIS ENERGY.
Set this parameter equal to a reference value of the accumulated inelastic hysteresis energy density
per cycle. The default is 1.0.
SOFTENING
Set SOFTENING=LINEAR (default) to specify a linear softening stress-strain response (after the
initiation of damage) for linear elastic materials or a linear evolution of the damage variable with
deformation (after the initiation of damage) for elastic-plastic materials.
Set SOFTENING=EXPONENTIAL to specify an exponential softening stress-strain response (after
the initiation of damage) for linear elastic materials or an exponential evolution of the damage
variable with deformation (after the initiation of damage) for elastic-plastic materials.
Set SOFTENING=TABULAR to specify the evolution of the damage variable with deformation
(after the initiation of damage) in tabular form. SOFTENING=TABULAR can be used only in
conjunction with TYPE=DISPLACEMENT.

*DAMAGE INITIATION: Specify material and contact properties to define
the initiation of damage.
This option is used to provide material properties that deﬁne the initiation of damage. The damage initiation
material models can be broadly classiﬁed into the following categories based upon their applications:
•
continuum damage and fracture in ductile metals,
•
continuum damage and instability in sheet metals,
•
continuum damage in ﬁber-reinforced composites,
•
continuum damage in ﬁber-reinforced composites using the multiscale material model,
•
continuum damage in ductile materials during low-cycle fatigue,
•
traction-separation based damage in cohesive elements,
•
damage in enriched elements (in the context of the extended ﬁnite element method), and
•
general stress/strain-based continuum damage.
This option can also be used in conjunction with the *SURFACE INTERACTION option to deﬁne a contact
property model that allows deﬁnition of damage initiation for cohesive surfaces.

*DAMPING: Specify material damping.
Warning: The use of stiffness proportional material damping or band-limited damping in Abaqus/Explicit
may reduce the stable time increment dramatically and can lead to longer analysis times. See Material
Damping.
This option is used to provide material damping for mode-based analyses and direct-integration dynamic analyses
in Abaqus/Standard and for explicit dynamic analysis in Abaqus/Explicit.
Damping is deﬁned in a material data block except in the case of elements deﬁned with the *BEAM GENERAL
SECTION option, the *SHELL GENERAL SECTION option, the *ROTARY INERTIA option, the *MASS option,
or the *SUBSTRUCTURE PROPERTY option. For the *BEAM GENERAL SECTION, the *SHELL GENERAL
SECTION, and the *SUBSTRUCTURE PROPERTY options the *DAMPING option must be used in conjunction
with the property references. For the *MASS and the *ROTARY INERTIA options damping must be speciﬁed
using either the ALPHA or the COMPOSITE parameter associated with these options. Damping can also come
from damper elements like connectors and dashpots, and it may also be deﬁned as step data using the *GLOBAL
DAMPING and *MODAL DAMPING options.
You must use multiple *DAMPING options if you want to deﬁne temperature dependence (and/or ﬁeld dependence
in Abaqus/Explicit) for more than one material damping coefﬁcient.
This option is ignored in mode-based procedures that use Lanczos or subspace iteration eigenvalue extraction
that does not use the SIM architecture (*FREQUENCY, EIGENSOLVER=SUBSPACE, SIM=NO).

to predict delamination/debonding growth at the interfaces in laminated composites in a low-cycle fatigue

• Direct Cyclic Analysis

• *TIME POINTS
Optional parameters:
CETOL
Set this parameter equal to the maximum difference in the creep strain increment calculated from
the creep strain rates based on conditions at the beginning and on conditions at the end of the
increment, thus controlling the time integration accuracy of the creep integration.
This parameter can be used in conjunction with the *TIME POINTS option. In this case
Abaqus/Standard will ensure the response will also be evaluated at each time point speciﬁed on the
*TIME POINTS option.
If both this parameter and the DELTMX parameter are omitted, ﬁxed time stepping will be used,
with a constant time increment equal to the initial time increment or by following precisely the time
points speciﬁed on the *TIME POINTS option.
CONTINUE
Set CONTINUE=YES to specify that the current *DIRECT CYCLIC step is a continuation of the
previous direct cyclic step. The displacement solution in the Fourier series obtained in the previous
*DIRECT CYCLIC step is then used as the starting values for the current step.
Set CONTINUE=NO (default) to reset all the displacement Fourier coefﬁcients to zero, thus allowing
application of cyclic loading conditions that are very different from those in the previous direct
cyclic step.
DELTMX
Set this parameter equal to the maximum temperature change to be allowed in an increment during
a direct cyclic analysis. Abaqus/Standard will restrict the time increment to ensure that this value
will not be exceeded at any node during any increment of the step.
This parameter can be used in conjunction with the *TIME POINTS option. In this case
Abaqus/Standard will ensure the response will also be evaluated at each time point speciﬁed on the
*TIME POINTS option.

If both this parameter and the CETOL parameter are omitted, ﬁxed time stepping will be used, with
a constant time increment equal to the initial time increment or by following precisely the time
points speciﬁed on the *TIME POINTS option.
FATIGUE
Include this parameter to perform a low-cycle fatigue analysis using a direct cyclic approach in
conjunction with the damage extrapolation technique. Multiple cycles can be included in a single
direct cyclic analysis. The analysis models progressive damage and failure on constitutive points
in the bulk materials based on a continuum damage approach. It can also be used to model
delamination/debonding growth at the interfaces in laminated composites.
TIME POINTS
Set this parameter equal to the name of the *TIME POINTS option that deﬁnes the time points at
which the response of the structure will be evaluated.
Data line to control incrementation and Fourier representation in a direct cyclic analysis without
the FATIGUE parameter:
First (and only) line:
1. Initial time increment. If this entry is omitted, a default value of 0.1 times the single loading
cycle period is assumed. If automatic incrementation is used, this should be a reasonable
suggestion for the initial increment size and will be adjusted as necessary. If direct incrementation
is used, this entry will be used as the constant time incrementation or will be ignored if the
*TIME POINTS option is speciﬁed.
2. Time of a single loading cycle.
3. Minimum time increment allowed. This entry is used only if the CETOL or DELTMX parameter
is speciﬁed. If this entry is omitted, a default value of the smaller of the suggested initial time
increment or 10−5 times the single loading cycle period is assumed.
4. Maximum time increment allowed. This entry is used only if the CETOL or DELTMX parameter
is speciﬁed. If this entry is omitted, the upper limit is equal to 0.1 times the single loading cycle
period.
5. Initial number of terms in the Fourier series. The value must be greater than 0 and less than 500.
It cannot be greater than half of the time of a single loading cycle divided by the initial time
increment. If the *TIME POINTS option is used, the number of terms in the Fourier series must
be less than half of the number of time points speciﬁed. Abaqus/Standard will automatically
adjust the number of Fourier terms used in the analysis if such a condition is not satisﬁed. The
default is 11.
6. Maximum number of terms in the Fourier series. It must be greater than 0 and less than 500.
The default is 25.

*DLOAD: Specify distributed loads.
This option is used to prescribe distributed loading. It is also used to apply concentrated or distributed wind,

Applying distributed loads
Required parameter for cyclic symmetry models in steady-state dynamics analyses:
CYCLIC MODE
Set this parameter equal to the cyclic symmetry mode number of loads that are applied in the current
steady-state dynamics procedure.
Optional parameters:
AMPLITUDE
Set this parameter equal to the name of the amplitude curve that deﬁnes the variation of the load
magnitude during the step.
If this parameter is omitted for uniform load types in an Abaqus/Standard analysis, the reference
magnitude is applied immediately at the beginning of the step or linearly over the step, depending
on the value assigned to the AMPLITUDE parameter on the *STEP option (see Deﬁning an Analysis).
If this parameter is omitted in an Abaqus/Explicit analysis, the reference magnitude is applied
immediately at the beginning of the step.
Amplitude references are ignored for nonuniform loads given by user subroutine DLOAD in an
Abaqus/Standard analysis. Amplitude references are passed into user subroutine VDLOAD in an
Abaqus/Explicit analysis.
Only the load magnitude is changed with time. Quantities such as the direction of an applied gravity
load and the ﬂuid surface level in hydrostatic pressure loading are not changed.
CONSTANT RESULTANT
Set CONSTANT RESULTANT=NO (default) if surface traction vectors, edge traction vectors, or
edge moments are to be integrated over the surface in the current conﬁguration.
Abaqus Keywords Guide
452
*DLOAD

Set CONSTANT RESULTANT=YES if surface traction vectors, edge traction vectors, or edge
moments are to be integrated over the surface in the reference conﬁguration.
The CONSTANT RESULTANT parameter is valid only for uniform and nonuniform surface
tractions and edge loads (including edge moments); it is ignored for all other load types.
FOLLOWER
Set FOLLOWER=YES (default) if a prescribed traction or shell-edge load is to rotate with the
surface or shell edge in a large-displacement analysis (live load).
Set FOLLOWER=NO if a prescribed traction or edge load is to remain ﬁxed in a large-displacement
analysis (dead load).
The FOLLOWER parameter is valid only for traction and edge load labels TRVECn, TRVEC,
TRVECnNU, TRVECNU, EDLDn, and EDLDnNU. It is ignored for all other load labels.
OP
Set OP=MOD (default) for existing *DLOADs to remain, with this option modifying existing
distributed loads or deﬁning additional distributed loads.
Set OP=NEW if all existing *DLOADs applied to the model should be removed. New distributed
loads can be deﬁned.
ORIENTATION
Set this parameter equal to the name given for the *ORIENTATION option (Orientations) used to
specify the local coordinates in which components of traction or shell-edge loads are speciﬁed.
The ORIENTATION parameter is valid only for traction and edge load labels TRSHRn, TRSHR,
TRSHRnNU, TRSHRNU, TRVECn, TRVEC, TRVECnNU, TRVECNU, EDLDn, and EDLDnNU.
It is ignored for all other load labels.
REF NODE
This parameter applies only to Abaqus/Explicit analyses and is relevant only for viscous and
stagnation body force and pressure loads when the velocity at the reference node is used.
Set this parameter equal to either the node number of the reference node or the name of a node set
containing the reference node. If the name of a node set is chosen, the node set must contain exactly
one node. If this parameter is omitted, the reference velocity is assumed to be zero.
REGION TYPE
This parameter applies only to Abaqus/Explicit analyses.
This parameter is relevant only for pressure loads applied to the boundary of an adaptive mesh
domain. If a distributed pressure load is applied to a surface in the interior of an adaptive mesh
domain, the nodes on the surface will move with the material in all directions (they will be
nonadaptive). Abaqus/Explicit will create a boundary region automatically on the surface subjected
to the deﬁned pressure load.
Set REGION TYPE=LAGRANGIAN (default) to apply the pressure to a Lagrangian boundary
region. The edge of a Lagrangian boundary region will follow the material while allowing adaptive
meshing along the edge and within the interior of the region.
Set REGION TYPE=SLIDING to apply the pressure load to a sliding boundary region. The edge
of a sliding boundary region will slide over the material. Adaptive meshing will occur along the
edge and in the interior of the region. Mesh constraints are typically applied on the edge of a sliding
boundary region to ﬁx it spatially.
Set REGION TYPE=EULERIAN to apply the pressure to an Eulerian boundary region. This option
is used to create a boundary region across which material can ﬂow. Mesh constraints must be used
normal to an Eulerian boundary region to allow material to ﬂow through the region. If no mesh
453
Abaqus Keywords Guide
*DLOAD

constraints are applied, an Eulerian boundary region will behave in the same way as a sliding
boundary region.
Optional, mutually exclusive parameters for matrix generation and steady-state dynamics
analyses (direct, modal, or subspace):
IMAGINARY
Include this parameter to deﬁne the imaginary (out-of-phase) part of the loading.
REAL
Include this parameter (default) to deﬁne the real (in-phase) part of the loading.
Data lines to define all distributed loads except those special cases described below:
First line:
1. Element number or element set label.
2. Distributed load type label (see About the Element Library).
3. Reference load magnitude, which can be modiﬁed by the use of the *AMPLITUDE option. For
nonuniform loads the magnitude must be deﬁned in user subroutine DLOAD for Abaqus/Standard
and VDLOAD for Abaqus/Explicit. If given, this value will be passed into the user subroutine
in an Abaqus/Standard analysis.

4. 1-component of the traction vector direction.
5. 2-component of the traction vector direction.

For a two-dimensional or axisymmetric analysis, only the ﬁrst two components of the traction vector direction
need to be speciﬁed. For the shear traction load labels TRSHRn, TRSHR, TRSHRnNU, or TRSHRNU, the
loading direction is computed by projecting the speciﬁed traction vector direction down upon the surface in the
reference conﬁguration. For nonuniform loads in Abaqus/Standard the magnitude and traction vector direction
must be deﬁned in user subroutine UTRACLOAD. If given, the magnitude and vector will be passed into the
user subroutine in an Abaqus/Standard analysis.

First line:
1. Element number or element set label. If this ﬁeld is left blank, the load is applied to all elements
in the model that support the load type and have mass contributions speciﬁed (as required by

Data lines to define rotordynamic loads (Abaqus/Standard only):
First line:

Rotordynamic loads are supported only for three-dimensional continuum and cylindrical elements, shell elements,
membrane elements, beam elements, and rotary inertia elements. The spinning axis deﬁned as part of the load
must be the axis of symmetry for the structure. Therefore, beam elements must be aligned with the symmetry
axis. In addition, one of the principal directions of each loaded rotary inertia element must be aligned with the
symmetry axis, and the inertia components of the rotary inertia elements must be symmetric about this axis.
Repeat this data line as often as necessary to define rotordynamic loads for different elements or
element sets.

First line:
1. The element number or element set label is optional for gravity loads. If this ﬁeld is left blank,

moments are to be integrated over the surface in the reference conﬁguration.
The CONSTANT RESULTANT parameter is valid only for uniform and nonuniform surface
tractions and edge loads (including edge moments); it is ignored for all other load types.
FOLLOWER
Set FOLLOWER=YES (default) if a prescribed traction or shell-edge load is to rotate with the
surface or shell edge in a large-displacement analysis (live load).
Set FOLLOWER=NO if a prescribed traction or edge load is to remain ﬁxed in a large-displacement
analysis (dead load).
The FOLLOWER parameter is valid only for traction and edge load labels TRVEC, TRVECNU,
EDLD, and EDLDNU. It is ignored for all other load labels.
OP
Set OP=MOD (default) for existing *DSLOADs to remain, with this option modifying existing
distributed loads or deﬁning additional distributed loads.
Set OP=NEW if all existing *DSLOADs applied to the model should be removed. New distributed
loads can be deﬁned.
The OP parameter is ignored for the nodal pressure distributed load type label (NP). All existing
*DSLOADs are removed before applying the nodal pressure loads.
ORIENTATION
Set this parameter equal to the name given for the *ORIENTATION option (Orientations) used to
specify the local coordinates in which components of traction or shell-edge loads are speciﬁed.
The ORIENTATION parameter is valid only for traction and edge load labels TRSHR, TRSHRNU,
TRVEC, TRVECNU, EDLD, and EDLDNU. It is ignored for all other load labels.
REF NODE
This parameter applies only to Abaqus/Explicit analyses and is relevant only for viscous and
stagnation pressure loads when the velocity at the reference node is used.
Set this parameter equal to either the node number of the reference node or the name of a node set
containing the reference node. If the name of a node set is chosen, the node set must contain exactly
one node. If this parameter is omitted, the reference velocity is assumed to be zero.
Optional, mutually exclusive parameters for matrix generation and steady-state dynamics

Required parameters:

analysis. Surfaces used in this option must be among those listed in the *SUBMODEL model
deﬁnition option.
Optional parameters:
INC
This parameter can be used only in a static linear perturbation step (General and Perturbation

Defining a dynamic analysis in Abaqus/Standard
Optional parameter for the subspace projection method:
SUBSPACE
Include this parameter to choose the subspace projection method (explicit integration of the model
projected onto the eigenvectors obtained in the last *FREQUENCY step preceding this step).
If this parameter is omitted, implicit time integration of the dynamic equations for all global level
degrees of freedom is used.
Optional parameters for the general implicit integration method:
ADIABATIC
Include this parameter if an adiabatic stress analysis is to be performed. This parameter is relevant
only for isotropic metal plasticity materials with a Mises yield surface and when the *INELASTIC
HEAT FRACTION option has been speciﬁed.
ALPHA
Set this parameter equal to a nondefault value of the numerical (artiﬁcial) damping control parameter,
, in the implicit operator for TIME INTEGRATOR=HHT-TF or HHT-MD. Allowable values are
0 (no damping) to –0.5. The value of −0.333 provides maximum damping. The default for TIME
INTEGRATOR=HHT-TF is ALPHA=−0.05, which provides slight numerical damping.
APPLICATION
Use this parameter to choose a time integration method. Other parameter values are determined by
the time integration method selected. You can override the defaults by specifying these parameter
values directly.
Set APPLICATION=TRANSIENT FIDELITY (default for problems without contact in the model)
to choose a method for an accurate solution with slight numerical damping. The TIME
Abaqus Keywords Guide
484
*DYNAMIC

INTEGRATOR=HHT-TF, IMPACT=AVERAGE TIME, and
INCREMENTATION=CONSERVATIVE are set.
Set APPLICATION=MODERATE DISSIPATION (default for problems with contact in the model)
to choose a method with larger than default numerical damping and a more aggressive time
incrementation scheme at the expense of some solution accuracy. The TIME
INTEGRATOR=HHT-MD, IMPACT=NO, and INCREMENTATION=AGGRESSIVE are set.
Set APPLICATION=QUASI-STATIC to choose a method with very signiﬁcant numerical damping
that is primarily intended to obtain quasi-static solutions. The TIME INTEGRATOR=BWE,
IMPACT=NO, and INCREMENTATION=AGGRESSIVE values are set. In addition, the default
step amplitude is set to RAMP instead of STEP.
BETA
Set this parameter equal to a nondefault value, , in the implicit operator for TIME
INTEGRATOR=HHT-TF or HHT-MD. Allowable values are positive.
DIRECT
Include this parameter to choose direct user control of the incrementation through the step. If this
parameter is included and no contact impacts or releases occur, constant increments of the size
deﬁned on the data line are used. If this parameter is omitted, Abaqus/Standard uses the automatic
time incrementation scheme after trying the user's initial time increment for the ﬁrst attempt at the
ﬁrst increment. The DIRECT parameter and the HAFTOL and HALFINC SCALE FACTOR
parameters are mutually exclusive.
The DIRECT parameter may have the value NO STOP. If this value is included, the solution to an
increment is accepted after the maximum number of iterations allowed (as deﬁned in the *CONTROLS
option) have been done, even if the equilibrium tolerances are not satisﬁed. Small increments and
a minimum of two iterations are usually necessary if this value is used. This approach is not generally
recommended; it should be used only in special cases when the analyst has a thorough understanding
of how to interpret results obtained in this way.
GAMMA
Set this parameter equal to a nondefault value, , in the implicit operator for TIME
INTEGRATOR=HHT-TF or HHT-MD. Allowable values are greater or equal to 0.5.
HAFTOL
Set this parameter equal to the half-increment residual tolerance to be used with the automatic time
incrementation scheme. For automatic time incrementation this value controls the accuracy of the
solution if HALFINC SCALE FACTOR is not speciﬁed. It is recommended that the HALFINC
SCALE FACTOR parameter be used instead of the HAFTOL parameter. If both are included, the
HAFTOL parameter is ignored. The DIRECT and HAFTOL parameters are mutually exclusive.
The HAFTOL parameter has dimensions of force and is usually chosen by comparison with typical
actual force values, such as applied forces or expected reaction forces. The following guidelines
may be helpful. For problems where considerable plasticity or other dissipation is expected to damp
out the high frequency response, choose HAFTOL as 10 to 100 times typical actual force values
for moderate accuracy and low cost; choose HAFTOL as 1 to 10 times typical actual force values
for higher accuracy. In such cases smaller values of HAFTOL are usually not needed.
For elastic cases with little damping the high frequency modes usually remain important throughout
the problem; therefore, HAFTOL values should be smaller than recommended above. Choose
HAFTOL as 1 to 10 times typical actual force values for moderate accuracy; choose HAFTOL as
0.1 to 1 times actual force values for higher accuracy.
HALFINC SCALE FACTOR
485
Abaqus Keywords Guide
*DYNAMIC

Set this parameter equal to a scale factor applied to Abaqus/Standard calculated time average force
and moment values to be used as the half-increment residual tolerance with the automatic time
incrementation solution accuracy checking scheme. The DIRECT and HALFINC SCALE FACTOR
parameters are mutually exclusive. The HALFINC SCALE FACTOR is ignored when NOHAF
parameter is set.
The HALFINC SCALE FACTOR parameter is unitless. As a guideline, with smaller HALFINC
SCALE FACTOR values, more accurate solutions should be obtained at the expense of using ﬁner
time increments. By default for APPLICATION=TRANSIENT FIDELITY, it is set to 10000 if
contact is present in the model and to 1000 otherwise. These defaults differ from the suggested
HAFTOL ratios primarily because the HALFINC SCALE FACTOR is applied to known force
averages; hence, they need not be as conservative.
IMPACT
Use this parameter to choose a time incrementation type when contact impacts or releases occur
during analysis.
Set IMPACT=AVERAGE TIME to choose a time incrementation scheme that employs average
time of impact/release cut backs to enforce energy balance and maintains velocities and accelerations
compatible on the active contact interface. The IMPACT=AVERAGE TIME and TIME
INTEGRATOR=BWE settings are mutually exclusive.
Set IMPACT=CURRENT TIME to choose a “marching through” scheme without impact/release
cut backs. The velocities and accelerations are compatible on the active contact interface.
Set IMPACT=NO to choose a “marching through” scheme without impact/release cut backs and
without velocity/acceleration compatibility computations.
INCREMENTATION
Use this parameter to choose a general time incrementation type.
Set INCREMENTATION=CONSERVATIVE to choose a time incrementation scheme that
maximizes solution accuracy.
Set INCREMENTATION=AGGRESSIVE to choose a time incrementation scheme based only on
convergence history, similar to a scheme typically used in static problems without rate or history
dependence. Setting INCREMENTATION=AGGRESSIVE also sets the value of the NOHAF
parameter.
INITIAL
By default, Abaqus/Standard will calculate or recalculate accelerations at the beginning of the step
if an IMPACT value other than NO is used. Set INITIAL=NO to bypass the calculation of initial
accelerations at the beginning of the step.
If INITIAL=NO, Abaqus/Standard assumes that the initial accelerations for the current step are zero
if the current step is the ﬁrst *DYNAMIC step. If the immediately preceding step was also a
*DYNAMIC step, using INITIAL=NO causes Abaqus/Standard to use the accelerations from the
end of the previous step to continue the new step. This is appropriate only if the loading does not
change suddenly at the start of the new step.
NOHAF
Include this parameter to suppress calculation of the half-increment residuals and thus skip some
accuracy checking for the automatic time incrementation scheme. For ﬁxed time incrementation
with the DIRECT parameter included, Abaqus/Standard calculates the half-increment residuals by
default; the NOHAF parameter switches off this calculation, saving some of the solution cost.
RATE DEPENDENCE
Abaqus Keywords Guide
486
*DYNAMIC

This parameter can be used only if the quasi-static response is speciﬁed
(APPLICATION=QUASI-STATIC).
Set RATE DEPENDENCE=ON (default) to consider the strain rate–dependence when evaluating
the yield stress of a material and to consider the slip rate–dependence when evaluating the friction
coefﬁcient.
Set RATE DEPENDENCE=OFF to ignore the strain rate–dependence when evaluating the yield
stress of a material and to ignore the slip rate–dependence when evaluating the friction coefﬁcient.
SINGULAR MASS
Use this parameter to control velocity and acceleration adjustments if a singular global mass matrix
is detected during initialization or during contact impact/release computations.
Set SINGULAR MASS=ERROR (default) to issue an error message and stop execution if a singular
global mass matrix is detected when calculating the velocity and acceleration adjustments.
Set SINGULAR MASS=WARNING to issue a warning message and avoid these velocity and
acceleration adjustments (that is, continue time integration using the current velocities and
accelerations) if a singular global mass matrix is detected.
Set SINGULAR MASS=MAKE ADJUSTMENTS to adjust velocities and accelerations even if a
singular mass matrix is detected. This setting can result in large, non-physical velocity and/or
acceleration adjustments, which can, in turn, cause poor time integration solutions and artiﬁcial
convergence difﬁculties. This approach is not generally recommended; it should be used only in
special cases when the analyst has a thorough understanding of how to interpret results obtained
in this way.
TIME INTEGRATOR
Use this parameter to choose the time integration method.
Set TIME INTEGRATOR=BWE to choose the backward Euler time integrator.
Set TIME INTEGRATOR=HHT-TF to choose the Hilber-Hughes-Taylor time integrator with default
parameter settings which provide slight numerical damping. This is the default for
APPLICATION=TRANSIENT FIDELITY.
Set TIME INTEGRATOR=HHT-MD to choose the Hilber-Hughes-Taylor time integrator with
default parameter settings that provide moderate numerical damping. This is the default for
APPLICATION=MODERATE DISSIPATION.
Data line for a transient dynamic analysis:
First (and only) line:
1. Suggested initial time increment. For implicit integration, this same time increment will be used
throughout the step unless contact impacts or releases occur or the automatic time incrementation
scheme is used. If the SUBSPACE parameter is included, the smaller of this time increment or
80% of 
, where 
 is the circular frequency of the highest mode included in the dynamic
response analysis, is used throughout the step.
2. Time period of the step.
3. Minimum time increment allowed. If a smaller time increment than this value is needed, the
analysis is terminated. If this entry is zero, a default value of the smaller of the suggested initial
time increment or 10−5 times the time period of the step is assumed.
4. Maximum time increment allowed. Only useful for automatic time incrementation. If this value
is zero, the default depends on the APPLICATION setting. If APPLICATION=TRANSIENT
FIDELITY, the maximum time increment allowed is the time period of the step divided by 100.

COHESIVE OFFSET
This parameter is relevant only for pore pressure, coupled temperature-pore pressure, and coupled

Set COHESIVE OFFSET=USER to deﬁne cohesive offset in user subroutine UCOHESIVEOFFSET.
COMPRESSION FACTOR
This parameter is meaningful only for uncoupled traction-separation elastic behavior.
Set this parameter equal to the factor by which the elastic modulus, 
, must be scaled in
compression. The use of a factor that is different from 1.0 results in different elastic moduli in tension

Required parameters:
LOW FREQUENCY
Include this parameter to specify that the electromagnetic response is calculated based on the standard
low-frequency assumption of neglecting the effects of displacement currents in Maxwell's equations.
One of the following mutually exclusive parameters is required:
TIME HARMONIC
Include this parameter to calculate the time harmonic linear electromagnetic response of the system
subjected to harmonic excitation.
TRANSIENT
Include this parameter to calculate the transient electromagnetic response of the system.
Optional parameters:
DIRECT
This parameter can be used only with the TRANSIENT parameter to select direct user control of
the incrementation through the step. If this parameter is used, constant increments of the size deﬁned
by the ﬁrst item on the data line are used. If this parameter is omitted, Abaqus/Standard will choose
the increments (after trying the user's initial time increment for the ﬁrst attempt at the ﬁrst increment).
STABILIZATION
Include this parameter to activate the stabilization scheme that may be needed in some situations
to obtain an electromagnetic solution. It deﬁnes a factor that is used by Abaqus in the stabilization
computations. If this parameter is included without a value, the default value is assumed to be 1.0.
The parameter may be set to a higher value to increase the stabilization or to a lower value to decrease
it.

First line:
1. Lower limit of frequency range or a single frequency, in cycles/time.

If this entry is zero or is not speciﬁed, a default value that is equal to the total time period of the
step is assumed.
2. Time period of the step.
3. Minimum time increment allowed. If a smaller time increment than this value is needed, the
analysis is terminated. If this entry is zero, a default value of the smaller of the suggested initial
time increment or 10−5 times the time period of the step is assumed.
4. Maximum time increment allowed. Only used for automatic time incrementation. If this value
is not speciﬁed, no upper limit is imposed.

Optional parameters when the *ELEMENT OUTPUT option is used in conjunction with the
*OUTPUT, FIELD option:
ALLSECTIONPTS

names are appended to the output variables for output at the micro-level.
POSITION
Set POSITION=AVERAGED AT NODES if the values being written are the averages of values

centroid of the reference surface of a shell element, the midpoint between the end nodes in a beam
element).
Set POSITION=INTEGRATION POINTS (default) if values are being written at the integration

REBAR
This parameter applies only to rebar in membrane, shell, and surface elements.
This parameter can be used to obtain output only for the rebar in the element set speciﬁed; output
for the matrix material is not given. It can be used with or without a value. If it is used without a

to the rebar on the *REBAR LAYER option to specify output for that particular rebar in the element
set.
If this parameter is omitted in a model that includes rebar, the output requests govern the output for

1. Specify a list of the section points in the shell, beam, or layered solid at which variables should
be written to the output database. If this data line is omitted, the variables are written at the
default output points. For section points on a meshed beam cross-section, specify a list of

NAME
Set this parameter equal to a label that will be used to refer to this progressive element activation.
Optional parameters:
FOLLOW DEFORMATION
Set FOLLOW DEFORMATION=NO (default) for elements that have not yet been activated to
remain in their initial positions.
Set FOLLOW DEFORMATION=YES for elements that have not yet been activated to follow the
movement of the active elements to prevent their excessive deformation. This parameter is applicable
in a stress displacement analysis; in a heat transfer analysis, where temperature is the only active
degree of freedom, setting FOLLOW DEFORMATION=YES is not meaningful and will be changed
to FOLLOW DEFORMATION=NO.
FREE SURFACE
Set FREE SURFACE=NONE (default) for convection or radiation boundary conditions to be applied
on the full exposed areas of the element facets. If the element is partially ﬁlled, the cooling is applied
on the full element facet area.
Set FREE SURFACE=FACET for user subroutine UEPACTIVATIONFACET to be called at the
start of the increment for each element. You can prescribe the facet area and the increment time for
which the facet area is exposed for cooling. You can prescribe the exposed areas on the element
facets and the internal cut facet for partial element activation. This feature is supported only for

This option is used to generate modal stress and strain recovery matrices for a substructure. These matrices can
be used to recover components of the stress and strain tensors within the substructure from a solution given at
all substructure degrees of freedom (generalized displacements) including the retained nodal degrees of freedom
and the generalized coordinates corresponding to the substructure dynamic modes.

Level:  Step
References:
• *SUBSTRUCTURE GENERATE

Required parameters:
POSITION
Set POSITION=AVERAGED AT NODES if the values being recovered are the averages of values
extrapolated to the nodes of the elements in the set. Since variables may be discontinuous between
elements with different properties, averaging occurs only over those elements contributing to a node
that have the same type with the following priority (in descending order): solid, shell, beam, other
element types. Therefore, if solid and shell elements contribute to a node, results averaged over
solid elements overwrite the other results at the node.
Set POSITION=CENTROIDAL if values are being recovered at the centroid of the elements (the
centroid of the reference surface of a shell element, the midpoint between the end nodes of a beam
element).
Optional parameters:
ELSET
Set this parameter equal to the name of the element set for which the element results recovery should
be enabled. If this parameter is omitted, the modal recovery matrices are generated for all elements
in the model.
Data lines to define section point and tensor variables:
First line (optional):
1. Give a section point in the beam, shell, or layered solid at which tensor components should be
recovered. Generation of the recovery matrices is supported for a single section point. If this

made.
LOWER BOUND
This parameter is meaningful only in an adjoint design sensitivity analysis.
This parameter is used to specify a lower bound on the design response value below which adjoint
sensitivities are not calculated. That is, if the value of the design response value is below the speciﬁed

Set this parameter equal to the name of the node set for which this sensitivity output is being made.
The element response is summed over all the nodes in this node set.

the minimum absolute value of the element set. This parameter is not available for design responses
in a steady-state dynamic analysis.

the minimum value for the element set.
Set OPERATOR=SUB to indicate that the calculation method for the design response represents
the difference between the maximum and the minimum values for the element set.

This parameter is meaningful only in an adjoint design sensitivity analysis.
Set this parameter equal to the name of an orientation deﬁnition to be used to deﬁne a local coordinate
system for the element response.
UPPER BOUND
This parameter is meaningful only in an adjoint design sensitivity analysis.
This parameter is used to specify an upper bound on the design response value above which adjoint
sensitivities are not calculated. That is, if the value of the design response value is above the speciﬁed
upper bound, then only the design response value is written to the output database, but not the
corresponding adjoint sensitivities.

3. The output variable description. The description is treated as a label; therefore, it must adhere
to the conventions for labels (see Input Syntax Rules), with the exception that case will be

requested using the *ELEMENT OUTPUT option, the output identifier for element solution-dependent
variables for which a name has been specified under this option will consist of the string “ESDV_,”
followed by the specified name. Similarly, the descriptions specified under this option will be used in
the corresponding field descriptions written to the output database. If an output name and a description

2. Number of user-deﬁned output variables required at the integration points of an element.
3. Table collection name associated with the element user-deﬁned variable deﬁnition.
Second line (required only to specify output descriptions for select element user-defined
variables):
1. Identiﬁer of the element user-deﬁned output variable for which an output key and a description
are being given.
The identiﬁer consists of the element user variable name and index. For instance, use UVAREn
and UVARPTn as identiﬁers of the n-th user-deﬁned output variables for the whole element and
for the integration points of the element, respectively.

2. The element user-deﬁned output variable key.
The key is treated as a label; therefore, it must adhere to the conventions for labels (see Input

3. The element user-deﬁned output variable description.
The description is treated as a label; therefore, it must adhere to the conventions for labels (see
Input Syntax Rules), with the exception that case is preserved.
Repeat this data line for each element user-defined output variable for which an output name and a

output of element user variables, the output identifier for element user variables for which a name has
been specified under this option consists of the string “UVARE_,” or “UVARPT_,” followed by the
specified name. Similarly, the descriptions specified under this option are used in the corresponding
field descriptions written to the output database. If you do not specify an output name and a description
for an element user-defined output variable, Abaqus/Standard uses the output identifier UVAREn and
description "User-defined element output variables for whole element" or the output identifier UVARPTn
and description "User-defined element output variables at integration points."
Data line to specify the number of element user variables if the PROPERTIES parameter is
used:

The identiﬁer consists of the element user variable name and index. The index value is 1 for the
ﬁrst element user-deﬁned output variable.
2. The element user-deﬁned output variable key.
The key is treated as a label; therefore, it must adhere to the conventions for labels (see Input

Optional parameters:
DIRECTIONS
This parameter applies only to Abaqus/Standard analyses.
This parameter is used to obtain the directions of local element or material coordinate systems when
component output is requested. The directions are written as a separate record for each point at
which a local coordinate system is used. See Results File for a detailed description.
Set DIRECTIONS=NO (default) if the local coordinate directions should not be written.
Set DIRECTIONS=YES if the local coordinate directions should be written.
ELSET
Set this parameter equal to the name of the element set for which this output request is being made.
If this parameter is omitted, the output will be written for all elements in the model. In an
Abaqus/Explicit analysis, output will also be written for all of the rebars in the model. The REBAR
parameter must be included in an Abaqus/Standard analysis to obtain rebar output.
FREQUENCY
This parameter applies only to Abaqus/Standard analyses.
Set this parameter equal to the output frequency, in increments. The output will always be written
to the results ﬁle at the last increment of each step unless FREQUENCY=0. The default is
FREQUENCY=1. Set FREQUENCY=0 to suppress the output.
LAST MODE
This parameter applies only to Abaqus/Standard analyses.
This parameter is useful only during eigenvalue extraction for natural frequencies (Natural Frequency
Extraction) and for eigenvalue buckling estimation (Eigenvalue Buckling Prediction). Set this
parameter equal to the highest mode number for which output is required.
The default value is LAST MODE=N, where N is the number of modes extracted. If the MODE
parameter is used, the default value is LAST MODE=M, where M is the value of the MODE
parameter.
MODE
This parameter applies only to Abaqus/Standard analyses.

*EL FILE

This parameter is useful only during eigenvalue extraction for natural frequencies (Natural Frequency
Extraction) and for eigenvalue buckling estimation (Eigenvalue Buckling Prediction). Set this
parameter equal to the ﬁrst mode number for which output is required. The default is MODE=1.
When performing a *FREQUENCY analysis, the normalization will follow the format set by the
NORMALIZATION parameter. Otherwise, the normalization is such that the largest displacement
component in the mode has a magnitude of 1.0.
POSITION
This parameter applies only to Abaqus/Standard analyses.
Set POSITION=AVERAGED AT NODES if the values being written are the averages of values
extrapolated to the nodes of the elements in the set. Since variables can be discontinuous between
elements with different properties, Abaqus/Standard breaks the output into separate tables for
different element property deﬁnitions within the element set speciﬁed. Abaqus/Standard will also
output elements of differing types separately. Thus, averaging will occur only over elements that
contribute to a node that have the same type.
Set POSITION=CENTROIDAL if values are being written at the centroid of the element (the
centroid of the reference surface of a shell element, the midpoint between the end nodes of a beam
element).
Set POSITION=INTEGRATION POINTS (default) if values are being written at the integration
points at which the variables are actually calculated.
Set POSITION=NODES if the values being written are extrapolated to the nodes of each element
in the set but not averaged at the nodes.
REBAR
This parameter applies only to Abaqus/Standard analyses.
This parameter can be used to obtain output only for the rebar in the element set speciﬁed; output
for the matrix material will not be given. It can be used with or without a value. If it is used without
a value, the output will be given for all rebar in the element set. Its value can be set to the name
assigned to the rebar on the *REBAR option to specify output for that particular rebar in the element
set.
If this parameter is omitted in a model that includes rebar, the output requests govern the output for
the matrix material only (except for section forces, when the forces in the rebar are included in the
force calculation). Rebar output can be obtained only at the integration points in continuum and
beam elements. In shell and membrane elements rebar output can be obtained at the integration
points and at the centroid of the element.
Data lines to request element output in the results file in an Abaqus/Standard analysis:
First line (optional, and relevant only if integration point variables are being printed for shell,

points deﬁned in About the Element Library. A maximum number of 16 section points can be
speciﬁed. Repeat the *EL FILE option as often as needed if output at additional points is required.
For section points on a meshed beam cross-section, specify a list of user-deﬁned section point
labels. If this data line is omitted, all available section points will be written.

*EL PRINT: Define data file requests for element variables.
This option is used to provide tabular printed output of element variables (stresses, strains, etc.).
Products: Abaqus/Standard
Type:  History data
Level:  Step
References:
• Output to the Data and Results Files
Optional parameters:
ELSET
Set this parameter equal to the name of the element set for which this output request is being made.
If this parameter is omitted, the output will be printed for all elements in the model.
FREQUENCY
Set this parameter equal to the output frequency, in increments. The output will always be printed
at the last increment of each step unless FREQUENCY=0. The default is FREQUENCY=1. Set
FREQUENCY=0 to suppress the output.
LAST MODE
This parameter is useful only during eigenvalue extraction for natural frequencies (Natural Frequency
Extraction), complex eigenvalue extraction (Complex Eigenvalue Extraction), and for eigenvalue
buckling estimation (Eigenvalue Buckling Prediction). Set this parameter equal to the highest mode
number for which output is required.
The default value is LAST MODE=N, where N is the number of modes extracted. If the MODE
parameter is used, the default value is LAST MODE=M, where M is the value of the MODE
parameter.
MODE
This parameter is useful only during natural frequency extraction, complex eigenvalue extraction,
and eigenvalue buckling estimation. Set this parameter equal to the ﬁrst mode number for which
output is required. The default is MODE=1. When performing a SIM-based *FREQUENCY analysis
(EIGENSOLVER=AMS, EIGENSOLVER=LANCZOS, SIM, or EIGENSOLVER=SUBSPACE,
SIM) eigenvectors are always mass normalized. Otherwise, the normalization will follow the format
set by the NORMALIZATION parameter, with DISPLACEMENT as the default.
POSITION
Set POSITION=AVERAGED AT NODES if the values being printed are the averages of values
extrapolated to the nodes of the elements in the set. Since variables may be discontinuous between
elements with different properties, Abaqus/Standard breaks the output into separate tables for
different element property deﬁnitions within the element set speciﬁed. Abaqus/Standard will also
output elements of differing types separately. Thus, averaging will occur only over elements that
contribute to a node that have the same type.
Set POSITION=CENTROIDAL if values are being printed at the centroid of the element (the
centroid of the reference surface of a shell element, the midpoint between the end nodes of a beam
element).
535
*EL PRINT

Set POSITION=INTEGRATION POINTS (default) if values are being printed at the integration
points at which the variables are actually calculated.
Set POSITION=NODES if the values being written are extrapolated to the nodes of each element
in the set but not averaged at the nodes.
REBAR
This parameter can be used to obtain output only for the rebar in the element set speciﬁed; output
for the matrix material will not be given. It can be used with or without a value. If it is used without
a value, the output will be given for all rebar in the element set. Its value can be set to the name
assigned to the rebar on the *REBAR option to specify output for that particular rebar in the element
set.
If this parameter is omitted in a model that includes rebar, the output requests govern the output for
the matrix material only (except for section forces, when the forces in the rebar are included in the
force calculation).
Rebar output can be obtained only at the integration points in continuum and beam elements. In
shell and membrane elements rebar output can be obtained at the integration points and at the centroid
of the element.
SUMMARY
Set SUMMARY=YES (default) to obtain a summary and the locations of the maximum and minimum
values in each column of the table.
Set SUMMARY=NO to suppress this summary.
TOTALS
Set TOTALS=YES to print the total of each column in the table. This is useful, for example, to sum
the energies of a set of elements. The default is TOTALS=NO.
Data lines to request element output in the data file:
First line (optional, and relevant only if integration point variables are being printed for shell,
beam, or layered solid elements):
1. Give a list of the section points in the beam, shell, or layered solid at which variables should be
printed. If this line is omitted, the variables are printed at the default output points deﬁned in
About the Element Library. For section points on a meshed beam cross-section, specify a list of
user-deﬁned section point labels. If this data line is omitted, all available section points will be
printed. A maximum number of 16 section points can be speciﬁed. Repeat the *EL PRINT option
as often as needed if output at additional points is required.
Second line:
1. Give the identifying keys for the variables to be printed in a table for this element set. The keys
are deﬁned in Abaqus/Standard Output Variable Identiﬁers. All of the variables in each table
must be of the same type (integration point, section point, or whole element variables).
Repeat the second data line as often as necessary: each line defines a table. If this line is omitted, no
element output will be printed to the data file.

Set this parameter equal to the analysis step from which to import ﬁeld values when reading from
the SIM-database ﬁle.
If this parameter is speciﬁed, the TIME parameter to specify a snap-shot point and the START
TIME and END TIME parameters to specify a time range refer to step time. Otherwise, total time
is used.
END TIME
This parameter is meaningful only when importing ﬁeld values over a time range from a time-domain
analysis.
Set this parameter equal to the end time to import ﬁelds over a speciﬁed time range. Field values
are linearly interpolated between two saved time points in the upstream analysis results ﬁle to obtain
the ﬁeld values at the speciﬁed end time.
The time is speciﬁed as the step time when the STEP parameter is used; otherwise, total time is
assumed.
You must explicitly specify the end time value when the upstream and downstream analyses use
different time scales and TIME SCALING=ON is speciﬁed.
If the START TIME and the END TIME parameters are omitted, ﬁeld values are imported over the
entire analysis step when the STEP parameter is used. Otherwise, values are imported over the entire
analysis.
If the END TIME parameter is omitted, the end time is taken as the last saved ﬁelds of the upstream
analysis step when the STEP parameter is used. Otherwise, the end time is taken as the last saved
ﬁelds of the upstream analysis.

assumed.
If the TIME, MODE, and FREQ parameters are omitted, the last saved ﬁelds of the analysis step
are used when the STEP parameter is speciﬁed. Otherwise, the last saved values at the end of the

the region is a node set; use ELEMENTS to indicate that the region is an element set; or use
SURFACE to indicate that the region is a surface. The default is ELEMENTS.
2. Name of the region (node set, element set, or surface) deﬁned in the current model where imported
ﬁelds are speciﬁed.

previous analysis.
The region can be either a node set, an element set, or a surface regardless of the location where
imported ﬁelds are speciﬁed. When you import a node-based ﬁeld and specify an element set
or surface, the node-based ﬁeld is extracted from the nodes of the elements in the speciﬁed
element set or facets belonging to the speciﬁed surface. When an element-based ﬁeld is imported
and you specify a node set, the element ﬁeld is extracted from elements containing the nodes in
the node set; elements connected to nodes that are not in the node set are not included.

Optional parameters:
PROPERTIES
This parameter can be used only if the USER parameter is speciﬁed.
Set this parameter equal to the number of property values needed as data in user subroutine VFABRIC.
The default value is 0.
You can introduce state variables using the *DEPVAR option and update these variables within user
subroutine VFABRIC. You can delete the element, if needed, using one of these state variables.
STRESS FREE INITIAL SLACK
Set STRESS FREE INITIAL SLACK=YES (default) to generate zero stresses in regions under
initial compressive strains along the ﬁll and the warp directions (these initial compressive strains
may arise from modeling techniques such as the initial metric method—see *INITIAL CONDITIONS,
TYPE=REF COORDINATE). The stress remains zero as the strain is continuously recovered from
the initial compressive values toward the strain-free state. Once the initial slack is recovered, any
subsequent compressive strains generate stresses as per the material deﬁnition.
Set STRESS FREE INITIAL SLACK=NO to generate stresses in the initial conﬁguration as per
the material deﬁnition even over fabric regions that are under compressive strains.
Abaqus also offers a technique to introduce any initial stresses, both tensile and compressive, in
fabric materials gradually over a speciﬁed time period (see *SECTION CONTROLS).
USER
Include this parameter if the fabric stresses in a local system are updated in user subroutine VFABRIC
given the total and the incremental fabric strains in the local system.
If this parameter is omitted, you must include the *UNIAXIAL option to deﬁne the fabric response
using test data in terms of the fabric stresses and the fabric strains in the local system.

*FABRIC

The local system for the fabric material deﬁned either through the test data or the user subroutine
is initialized to the ﬁll and the warp yarn directions in the reference conﬁguration by using the

Set this parameter equal to the name of the property to be used with this fastener deﬁnition.
At least one of the following parameters is required:
ELSET
This parameter is applicable only when the fastener is modeled using connector elements.
If the connector elements are deﬁned explicitly, set this parameter equal to the name of the element
set containing the connector elements. If the connector elements are to be generated internally by
Abaqus, set this parameter equal to an empty element set name.

generated rigid beam MPCs are to be used to model the fastener.
Set this parameter equal to the name of the node set containing the reference nodes for this fastener
deﬁnition.

*FASTENER

Set ATTACHMENT METHOD=FACETOFACE (default) to select the default projection method
of locating fastening points on the speciﬁed surface or surfaces. The positioning point is projected
onto the nearest surface to create the ﬁrst fastening point, and normal projection is used to ﬁnd
subsequent fastening points.
Set ATTACHMENT METHOD=FACETOEDGE to ﬁnd the ﬁrst fastening point by projecting the
normal on the nearest surface and to ﬁnd subsequent fastening points at the closest points on the
speciﬁed surface or surfaces.
Set ATTACHMENT METHOD=EDGETOFACE to ﬁnd the closest point on the nearest surface
as the ﬁrst fastening point and to ﬁnd subsequent fastening points via normal projections on the
remaining surfaces.
Set ATTACHMENT METHOD=EDGETOEDGE to ﬁnd the closest fastening points on the speciﬁed
surface or surfaces.
Set ATTACHMENT METHOD=CONNECTORDIRECTION to establish fastening points on the
respective surfaces based on the axial direction of the connector element associated with the fastener.
This option is valid only if the ELSET parameter is speciﬁed without the REFERENCE NODE
SET parameter and the speciﬁed nodal positions for the connector element are not co-located.
COUPLING
This parameter controls whether the rotations of surface nodes participate in translational coupling
constraints for each fastening point.
Set COUPLING=CONTINUUM (default) to couple the displacement and rotation of each fastening
point to the displacement (but not rotation) of the surface nodes within the radius of inﬂuence.
Set COUPLING=STRUCTURAL to couple the displacement and rotation of each fastening point
to the displacement and rotation of the surface nodes within the radius of inﬂuence.
NUMBER OF LAYERS
Set this parameter equal to the number of layers for each fastener. If this parameter is omitted and
no surface is speciﬁed by the user or a single surface is speciﬁed by the user, Abaqus will form the
maximum possible number of layers for each fastener.
This parameter is ignored if multiple surfaces are speciﬁed on the data lines.
ORIENTATION
Set this parameter equal to the name of an orientation deﬁnition (see Orientations) that deﬁnes the
orientation of the fastener. If this parameter is omitted, the orientation of each fastener is determined
from the default local directions of the surface (see Conventions) that is closest to the reference node
for that fastener.
Fasteners support only rectangular, cylindrical, and spherical orientation deﬁnitions. Additional
rotations deﬁned as part of the orientation deﬁnition are ignored.
RADIUS OF INFLUENCE
Set this parameter equal to the maximum distance from the projection point on a connected surface
within which the nodes on that surface must lie to contribute to the motion of the projection point.
If this parameter is omitted, Abaqus will compute a default value of the radius of inﬂuence internally,
based on the fastener diameter and the surface facet lengths.
ROTATIONAL COUPLING
This parameter controls whether the displacement and the rotation of surface nodes participate in
rotational coupling constraints for each fastening point.

speciﬁed by the user, Abaqus will compute a default search radius based on the facet thickness (for
shell element facets) or characteristic facet length (for non-shell element facets) in the vicinity of
each positioning point.
UNSORTED
If this parameter is omitted, the connectivity of the fastening points is deﬁned by the relative positions
of their associated surfaces along the fastener projection direction.
If this parameter is included, the connectivity of the fastening points is deﬁned by the order in which
their associated surfaces appear on the data lines.
This parameter is ignored if no surfaces are speciﬁed on the data lines.

Optional parameters:
CETOL
Set this parameter equal to the maximum difference in the creep strain increment calculated from
the creep strain rates based on conditions at the beginning and on conditions at the end of the
increment, thus controlling the time integration accuracy of the creep integration.
This parameter can be used in conjunction with the *TIME POINTS option. In this case
Abaqus/Standard ensures that the response is also evaluated at each time point speciﬁed on the
*TIME POINTS option.
If both this parameter and the DELTMX parameter are omitted, ﬁxed time stepping will be used,
with a constant time increment equal to the initial time increment or by following precisely the time
points speciﬁed on the *TIME POINTS option.
DELTMX
Set this parameter equal to the maximum temperature change to be allowed in an increment during
a fatigue crack growth analysis. Abaqus/Standard restricts the time increment to ensure that this
value is not exceeded at any node during any increment of the step.
DIRECT
This parameter selects direct user control of the incrementation through the step. If this parameter
is used, constant increments of the size deﬁned by the ﬁrst item on the data line are used. If this
parameter is omitted, Abaqus/Standard will choose the increments (after trying the user's initial time
increment for the ﬁrst attempt at the ﬁrst increment).
TIME POINTS
Set this parameter equal to the name of the *TIME POINTS option that deﬁnes the time points at
which the response of the structure will be evaluated.
TYPE
Set TYPE=CONSTANT AMPLITUDE (default) to use the classical incremental method for each
cycle.

Optional parameters:
VARIABLE
Set this parameter equal to the ﬁeld variable number. The user must number the ﬁeld variables
consecutively from 1. The default is VARIABLE=1 unless the NUMBER parameter is used. The
VARIABLE and NUMBER parameters are mutually exclusive.
Optional parameters for using the data line format:
AMPLITUDE
Set this parameter equal to the name of the amplitude curve that gives the time variation of the ﬁeld
variable throughout the step (see Amplitude Curves).
If this parameter is omitted in an Abaqus/Standard analysis, the reference magnitude is applied
immediately at the beginning of the step or linearly over the step, depending on the value assigned
to the AMPLITUDE parameter on the *STEP option. If this parameter is omitted in an
Abaqus/Explicit analysis, the reference magnitude is applied linearly over the step.
INPUT
Set this parameter equal to the name of the alternate input ﬁle containing the data lines for this
option. See Input Syntax Rules for the syntax of such ﬁle names. If this parameter is omitted, it is
assumed that the data follow the keyword line.
OP
Set OP=MOD (default) for existing *FIELD variable values to remain, with this option modifying
existing values or deﬁning additional values.
Set OP=NEW if all existing *FIELD variable values should be removed. New ﬁeld variable values
can be deﬁned.
For a general analysis step, a ﬁeld variable that is removed via OP=NEW is reset to the value given
on the *INITIAL CONDITIONS option or to zero if no initial ﬁeld was deﬁned. For a linear
perturbation step, a ﬁeld variable that is removed via OP=NEW is always reset to zero. If a ﬁeld
variable is being returned to its initial condition values, the AMPLITUDE parameter described
above does not apply. Rather, the AMPLITUDE parameter given on the *STEP option governs the

*FIELD

behavior in an Abaqus/Standard analysis. In a multistep Abaqus/Standard analysis, the default is to
reset to zero. In an Abaqus/Explicit analysis the ﬁeld variable is always linearly ramped back to its
initial conditions. If the ﬁeld variable is being reset to a new value (not to its initial condition) via
OP=NEW, the AMPLITUDE parameter described above applies.
SECTION SPECIFICATION
Set SECTION SPECIFICATION=UNIFORM to deﬁne uniform ﬁeld variable values.
Required parameter for reading predefined field variable values from the results or output
database file:
FILE
Set this parameter equal to the name of the results (.fil) or output database (.odb) ﬁle from
which the data are read. The ﬁle extension is optional; however, if both .fil and .odb ﬁles exist,
the results ﬁle will be used if the INTERPOLATE parameter is omitted. If the INTERPOLATE
parameter is used, an output database ﬁle must exist. See Input Syntax Rules for the syntax of such
ﬁle names.
This parameter cannot be used in a *STATIC, RIKS analysis step.
Optional parameters for reading predefined field variable values from the results or output
database file:
BSTEP
Set this parameter equal to the step number (of the analysis whose results ﬁle is being used as input
to this option) that begins the history data to be read. If no value is supplied, Abaqus will begin
reading ﬁeld variable data from the ﬁrst step available on the ﬁle read.
BINC
Set this parameter equal to the increment number (of the analysis whose results or output database
ﬁle is being used as input to this option) that begins the history data to be read. If no value is supplied,
Abaqus will begin reading ﬁeld variable data from the ﬁrst increment available (excluding any zero
increments if the results ﬁle was written in Abaqus/Standard using *FILE FORMAT, ZERO
INCREMENT) for step BSTEP on the results or output database ﬁle.
ESTEP
Set this parameter equal to the step number (of the analysis whose results or output database ﬁle is
being used as input to this option) that ends the history data to be read. If no value is supplied,
ESTEP is taken as equal to BSTEP.
EINC
Set this parameter equal to the increment number (of the analysis whose results or output database
ﬁle is being used as input to this option) that ends the history data to be read. If no value is supplied,
EINC is taken as the last available increment of step ESTEP on the results ﬁle.
Required parameter for reading predefined field variable values from the output database file:
OUTPUT VARIABLE
Set this variable equal to the scalar nodal output variable that will be read from an output database
and used to initialize a speciﬁed predeﬁned ﬁeld. For a list of scalar nodal output variables that can

Abaqus Keywords Guide
*FIELD

Include this parameter to indicate that the scalar nodal output variable (speciﬁed by the OUTPUT

meshes. This feature is used to read nodal values from an output database ﬁle generated during a
previous Abaqus analysis.
Required parameter for defining data in user subroutine UFIELD or VUFIELD:
USER
Include this parameter to indicate that user subroutine UFIELD or VUFIELD will be used to deﬁne
ﬁeld variable values. For an Abaqus/Standard analysis UFIELD is called for each node given on
the data lines. For an Abaqus/Explicit analysis VUFIELD is called for each ﬁeld variable or for a
set of ﬁeld variables when the NUMBER parameter is used.
If values are also given on the data lines, these values will be ignored. If a results ﬁle has been
speciﬁed in addition to the user subroutine, values read from the results ﬁle will be passed into the
user subroutine for possible modiﬁcation.
Optional parameters for defining data in user subroutine UFIELD or VUFIELD:
NUMBER
This parameter permits multiple (possibly all) ﬁeld variables to be updated simultaneously in user
subroutine UFIELD or VUFIELD; for example, because they are interdependent. Set this parameter
equal to the number of ﬁeld variables to be updated simultaneously at a point. The NUMBER and
VARIABLE parameters are mutually exclusive.
BLOCKING
This parameter applies only to Abaqus/Explicit analyses. It is related to the NBLOCK variable used
in the user subroutine argument list.
Set BLOCKING=YES to enable blocking for a given node set. The blocking size will be set to a
predeﬁned value in Abaqus/Explicit.
Set BLOCKING=NO (default) to disable blocking.
Use BLOCKING=n to specify the blocking size.

the AMPLITUDE speciﬁcation.
Repeat this data line as often as necessary to define a field variable at different nodes or node sets.

First line:
1. Node set, node number, or blank.
2. Uniform ﬁeld variable value.
Repeat this data line as often as necessary to define uniform field variable values at various nodes
and node sets. If you omit both node numbers and node sets (that is, enter a blank space), the specified
uniform field variable is applied to all nodes in the model.

the deformed shape from the ﬁrst analysis.
Set CONFIGURATION=REFERENCE (default) to use the original conﬁguration of the source

MAPPER ALGORITHM
This parameter is relevant only when importing history-dependent ﬁelds when the mapper integrates
to convert intensive ﬁelds to extensive ﬁelds.
Set MAPPER ALGORITHM=SUBELEMENT (default) to select an algorithm based on the
subelements method. This algorithm provides conservative mapping with a smooth distribution.
Set MAPPER ALGORITHM=GLOBAL CONSERVATIVE to select an algorithm where the results
are conservative over the entire region. This algorithm is numerically less expensive than the
subelements method, and the mapped ﬁeld might show an uneven distribution in some cases.

speciﬁed as the source ﬁeld on the *EXTERNAL FIELD option.
Set TENSOR AVERAGING=INVARIANT to use a mapping technique that preserves the Mises
invariant of the stress tensor during mapping. This value is the default if output variable S is speciﬁed

If output variable ORIENT is speciﬁed as the source ﬁeld on the *EXTERNAL FIELD option, a
special averaging technique to map orientations is used by default. Output variable ORIENT is
available in the output database (.sim) ﬁle if material orientation is deﬁned in the element section
deﬁnition.
UNMAPPED MEMBERS TREATMENT
This parameter deﬁnes how to treat unmapped members (nodes or elements where the search
algorithm fails to ﬁnd intersections).
Set UNMAPPED MEMBERS TREATMENT=ERROR (default) to issue an error message and end
the simulation if members cannot be mapped properly when importing history-dependent ﬁelds.
When importing initial conditions and distributions, no values are applied. Unmapped members are
reported as a node set or element set.
Set UNMAPPED MEMBERS TREATMENT=NEAREST NEIGHBOR to assign a ﬁeld value
based on the nearest neighbor.
Set UNMAPPED MEMBERS TREATMENT=CONSTANT VALUE to specify a constant value
for the unmapped member.

a relative search tolerance, specify a factor relative to the characteristic facet size (default is 0.5).
For an absolute search tolerance, specify the search distance (default is 0.0).
2. Search position tolerance distance for the cloud point mapping algorithm in the element face
normal directions. For a relative search tolerance, specify a factor relative to the characteristic
facet size (default is 0.5). For an absolute search tolerance, specify the search distance (default

Optional parameters:
FILM AMPLITUDE
Set this parameter equal to the name of the *AMPLITUDE option that gives the variation of the ﬁlm
coefﬁcient, h, with time.
If this parameter is omitted in an Abaqus/Standard analysis, the reference ﬁlm coefﬁcient is applied
immediately at the beginning of the step and kept constant over the step, independent of the value
assigned to the AMPLITUDE parameter on the *STEP option. If this parameter is omitted in an
Abaqus/Explicit analysis, the reference ﬁlm coefﬁcient is applied immediately at the beginning of
the step.
The FILM AMPLITUDE parameter is ignored if a ﬁlm coefﬁcient is deﬁned to be a function of
temperature and ﬁeld variables via the *FILM PROPERTY option.
For nonuniform ﬁlm coefﬁcients, the ﬁlm coefﬁcient amplitude is deﬁned in user subroutine FILM
in Abaqus/Standard or user subroutine VFILM in Abaqus/Explicit; and FILM AMPLITUDE
references are used only to modify the ﬁlm coefﬁcient passed into the user subroutine.
OP
Set OP=MOD (default) for existing *FILMs to remain, with this option modifying existing ﬁlms
or deﬁning additional ﬁlms.
Set OP=NEW if all existing *FILMs applied to the model should be removed.
REGION TYPE
This parameter applies only to Abaqus/Explicit analyses.
This parameter is relevant only for ﬁlm conditions applied to the boundary of an adaptive mesh
domain. If a ﬁlm condition is applied to a surface in the interior of an adaptive mesh domain, the
nodes on the surface will move with the material in all directions (they will be nonadaptive).
Abaqus/Explicit will create a boundary region automatically on the surface subjected to the deﬁned
ﬁlm load.
Set REGION TYPE=LAGRANGIAN (default) to apply the ﬁlm condition to a Lagrangian boundary
region. The edge of a Lagrangian boundary region will follow the material while allowing adaptive
meshing along the edge and within the interior of the region.
Set REGION TYPE=SLIDING to apply the ﬁlm condition to a sliding boundary region. The edge
of a sliding boundary region will slide over the material. Adaptive meshing will occur along the
Abaqus Keywords Guide

edge and in the interior of the region. Mesh constraints are typically applied on the edge of a sliding
boundary region to ﬁx it spatially.
Set REGION TYPE=EULERIAN to apply the ﬁlm condition to an Eulerian boundary region. This
option is used to create a boundary region across which material can ﬂow. Mesh constraints must
be used normal to an Eulerian boundary region to allow material to ﬂow through the region. If no
mesh constraints are applied, an Eulerian boundary region will behave in the same way as a sliding
boundary region.
SINK AMPLITUDE
Set this parameter equal to the name of the *AMPLITUDE option that gives the variation of the sink
temperature, 
, with time.
If this parameter is omitted in an Abaqus/Standard analysis, the reference sink temperature is applied
immediately at the beginning of the step or linearly over the step, depending on the value assigned
to the AMPLITUDE parameter on the *STEP option (Deﬁning an Analysis). If this parameter is
omitted in an Abaqus/Explicit analysis, the reference sink temperature is applied immediately at

body dynamics solvers. The generated ﬂexible body entities are stored in the substructure .sim ﬁle and can be
postprocessed to generate the input data for external ﬂexible body dynamics solvers.
Alternatively, Abaqus/Standard can generate a ﬂexible body from a natural frequency extraction for use in the
Simpack ﬂexible body dynamics solver. In this case, Abaqus creates a separate .sim ﬁle named
jobname_FREQn.sim, where jobname is the name of the input ﬁle or analysis job and n is the number of the
Abaqus step that performs the natural frequency extraction. In this ﬁle, Abaqus stores a modal system along
with the generated ﬂexible body entities.

this parameter is omitted, it is assumed that the data are constant or depend only on temperature.
See Material Data Deﬁnition for more information.
K-BASED
This parameter can be used only in conjunction with enriched elements with MIXED MODE
BEHAVIOR=TABULAR or MIXED MODE BEHAVIOR=USER.
Include this parameter to specify a fatigue crack growth criterion based on a stress intensity factor
rather than the fracture energy release rate.

NODAL ENERGY RATE
This parameter is relevant only for TYPE=FATIGUE or TYPE=VCCT.
Include this parameter to indicate that the critical energy release rates should not be read from the
data lines but should be interpolated from the critical energy release rates speciﬁed at the nodes
with the *NODAL ENERGY RATE option. The exponents are still read from the data lines.
NORMAL DIRECTION
This parameter can be used only in conjunction with TYPE=ENHANCED VCCT, TYPE=FATIGUE,
or TYPE=VCCT for enriched elements in Abaqus/Standard.
Set NORMAL DIRECTION=MTS (default) to specify that the crack will propagate orthogonal to
the direction of the maximum tangential stress when the fracture criterion is satisﬁed.
Set NORMAL DIRECTION=1 to specify that the crack will propagate orthogonal to the element
local 1-direction when the fracture criterion is satisﬁed.

NPOWER
This parameter is relevant only for TYPE=PRX-VCCT and deﬁnes the rate of crack growth.
Set this parameter equal to a positive integer. The default is NPOWER=10.
POSITION
This parameter is relevant for TYPE=ENHANCED VCCT, TYPE=FATIGUE, TYPE=PRX-VCCT,
or TYPE=VCCT in predeﬁned initially partially bonded surfaces in Abaqus/Standard or when
NORMAL DIRECTION=MTS is speciﬁed in enriched elements.
In enriched elements, set POSITION=NONLOCAL to use a moving least-squares approximation
by polynomials to smooth out the normals of the individual crack facets in elements that satisfy the
fracture criterion to obtain the crack propagation direction along the crack front.
In predeﬁned initially partially bonded surfaces, set POSITION=NONLOCAL to use a moving
least-squares approximation by polynomials to smooth out the tangential directions of the individual
crack segments along the crack front to obtain a smoother pseudocrack tangential direction. This
direction is used for calculating energy release rates under mixed-mode loading.

Abaqus Keywords Guide
662
*FRACTURE CRITERION

Set this parameter equal to the number of material constants being speciﬁed for a user-deﬁned crack
growth criterion in a mixed-mode fatigue crack growth analysis. The parameter value must be a
nonzero value.
R CRACK DIRECTION
This parameter can be used only in conjunction with POSITION=NONLOCAL in enriched elements
or in predeﬁned initially partially bonded surfaces.
In enriched elements, set this parameter equal to the radius around the crack tip within which the
elements along the crack front are included for smoothing out the normals of the individual crack
facets to obtain the crack propagation direction.
In predeﬁned initially partially bonded surfaces, set this parameter equal to the radius around the
crack tip within which the elements along the crack front are included for smoothing out the tangential
directions of the individual crack segments along the crack front.
The default value is three times the typical element characteristic length along the crack front in the
model.
SYMMETRY
Include this parameter to compare the opening between the secondary surface and the symmetry
plane to half the COD value speciﬁed. The SYMMETRY parameter is relevant only for TYPE=COD
when the user is using symmetry conditions to model the problem. In this case the NORMAL
parameter must be speciﬁed on the *INITIAL CONDITIONS option.
TOLERANCE
Set this parameter equal to the tolerance within which the crack propagation criterion must be
satisﬁed. The default is TOLERANCE=0.1 for TYPE=CRITICAL STRESS, TYPE=COD, and
TYPE=CRACK LENGTH; for TYPE=ENHANCED VCCT, TYPE=PRX-VCCT, and TYPE=VCCT,
the default is TOLERANCE=0.2.
This parameter can also be used in a fatigue crack growth analysis (TYPE=FATIGUE) with gradual
release of the debonding forces in debonding nodes when DEBONDING FORCE=RAMP is used
on the *DEBOND option. Set this parameter equal to the tolerance within which the scalar damage
parameter reaches the value 1.0, resulting in the complete release of the debonding force. The default
is 0.05.
UNSTABLE GROWTH TOLERANCE
Set this parameter equal to the tolerance within which the unstable crack propagation criterion must
be satisﬁed for multiple nodes at and ahead of the crack tip to be allowed to debond without the cut
back of increment size in one increment when the TYPE=PRX-VCCT or VCCT criterion is satisﬁed
for an unstable crack problem.
If this parameter is included without a speciﬁed value, the default value is inﬁnity.
VISCOSITY
This parameter applies only to Abaqus/Standard analyses and can be used only in combination with
TYPE=ENHANCED VCCT or TYPE=VCCT.
Set this parameter equal to the value of the viscosity coefﬁcient used in the viscous regularization.

*FRAME SECTION: Specify a frame section.
This option is used to deﬁne the cross-section for frame elements. Since frame section geometry and material
descriptions are combined, no *MATERIAL reference is associated with this option.
Products: Abaqus/Standard
Type:  Model data
Level: Part,  Part instance
References:
• Frame Elements
• Frame Section Behavior
Required parameters:
ELSET
Set this parameter equal to the name of the element set for which the section is deﬁned.
Optional parameters:
BUCKLING
Include this parameter to indicate that buckling strut response is permitted for these elements and
that the default buckling envelope is to be used. When this parameter is included, the YIELD STRESS
parameter is required to determine 
 and 
 on the buckling envelope.
To include buckling strut response with a nondefault buckling envelope, use the *BUCKLING
ENVELOPE option in conjunction with the *FRAME SECTION option and the YIELD STRESS
parameter. If both the BUCKLING parameter and *BUCKLING ENVELOPE option are present,
the user-deﬁned buckling envelope takes precedence.
To deﬁne effective length factors and added lengths for the ﬁrst and second cross-section directions
with either the default or nondefault buckling envelope, use the *BUCKLING LENGTH option in
conjunction with the *FRAME SECTION option. To deﬁne buckling reduction factors for the ﬁrst
and second cross-section directions with either the default or nondefault buckling envelope, use the
*BUCKLING REDUCTION FACTORS option in conjunction with the *FRAME SECTION option.
DENSITY
Set this parameter equal to the mass density per unit volume of the frame element material. This
parameter is needed only when the mass of the element is required, such as in dynamic analysis or
for gravity loading.
DEPENDENCIES
Set this parameter equal to the number of ﬁeld variable dependencies included in the deﬁnition of
material properties, in addition to temperature. If this parameter is omitted, it is assumed that the
properties are constant or depend only on temperature. See Material Data Deﬁnition for more
information.
PINNED
Include this parameter to indicate that these elements have uniaxial response only; that is, the ends
have pinned connections.
671
*FRAME SECTION

If this parameter is used and both the BUCKLING parameter and the *BUCKLING ENVELOPE
option are absent, these elements have linear elastic uniaxial response from the beginning of the
analysis. If this parameter is used and the BUCKLING parameter or *BUCKLING ENVELOPE
option are present, these elements have uniaxial response with buckling and postbuckling behavior
in compression and isotropic hardening plasticity in tension as described by the buckling envelope
option from the beginning of the analysis. The *BUCKLING LENGTH option can be used with this
parameter when the BUCKLING parameter or *BUCKLING ENVELOPE option is present.
This parameter cannot be used with the PLASTIC DEFAULTS parameter or with any of the
*PLASTIC options.
PLASTIC DEFAULTS
Include this parameter to indicate that elastic-plastic material response is included and that all plastic
options are created with default values based on the yield stress deﬁned with the YIELD STRESS
parameter. The YIELD STRESS parameter is required when this parameter is used.
To include elastic-plastic material response with user-deﬁned plastic material response, use one or
more (as appropriate) of the *PLASTIC AXIAL, *PLASTIC M1, *PLASTIC M2, and *PLASTIC
TORQUE options in conjunction with the *FRAME SECTION option. If the PLASTIC DEFAULTS
and YIELD STRESS parameters are omitted, only those plastic options speciﬁed will be included
in the elastic-plastic material response.
This parameter cannot be used with the PINNED parameter.
SECTION
Set this parameter equal to the name of a library section to choose a standard library section (see
Beam Cross-Section Library). The following cross-sections are available for elastic frame elements
(when elastic-plastic and buckling strut response are omitted):
•
BOX, for a rectangular, hollow box section.
•
CIRC, for a solid circular section.
•
GENERAL, for a general cross-section (default).
•
I, for an I-beam section.
•
PIPE, for a hollow, circular section.
•
RECT, for a solid rectangular section.
For elastic-plastic material response the only available plastic interaction surface is an ellipsoid,
which is recommended for PIPE cross-sections only. Other cross-section types, except the GENERAL
section, can be used at the user's discretion.
For buckling strut response only the PIPE cross-section is available.
YIELD STRESS
Set this parameter equal to the yield stress for the material making up the cross-section.
This parameter is required when deﬁning default elastic-plastic material response with the PLASTIC
DEFAULTS parameter and when modeling buckling strut response by using the *BUCKLING
ENVELOPE option or the BUCKLING parameter.
ZERO
Set this parameter equal to the reference temperature for thermal expansion (
), if required. The
default is ZERO=0.

Optional parameters:
ACOUSTIC COUPLING
For the AMS eigensolver and Lanczos eigensolver, set ACOUSTIC COUPLING=ON to include
the effect of acoustic-structural coupling during the natural frequency extraction procedure in models
with acoustic and structural elements coupled using the *TIE option or in models with ASI-type
elements. This is the default option for the Lanczos eigensolver.
For the AMS eigensolver and Lanczos eigensolver based on the SIM architecture, set ACOUSTIC
COUPLING=PROJECTION to extract the uncoupled acoustic and structural modes and project the
acoustic-structural coupling operator during the natural frequency extraction procedure in models
with acoustic and structural elements coupled using the *TIE option. This is the default option for
the AMS eigensolver.
Set ACOUSTIC COUPLING=OFF to omit the projection of the acoustic-structural coupling operator
and to ignore the effect of acoustic-structural coupling during natural frequency extraction in models
with acoustic and structural elements coupled using the *TIE option or in models with ASI-type
elements.
This parameter is not relevant for the subspace iteration eigensolver.
DAMPING PROJECTION
This parameter is relevant only for the AMS eigensolver or for the Lanczos eigensolver used in
conjunction with the SIM parameter.
Set DAMPING PROJECTION=ON (default) to project the viscous and structural damping operators
during the natural frequency extraction procedure. If there is no damping deﬁned in the model,
Abaqus/Standard does not perform the projection.
Set DAMPING PROJECTION=OFF to omit the projection of damping operators.
EIGENSOLVER
Set EIGENSOLVER=LANCZOS (default) to invoke the Lanczos eigensolver.
Set EIGENSOLVER=AMS to invoke the automatic multilevel substructuring (AMS) eigensolver.
Set EIGENSOLVER=SUBSPACE to invoke the subspace iteration eigensolver.
NORMALIZATION
Set NORMALIZATION=DISPLACEMENT to normalize the eigenvectors so that the largest
displacement, rotation, or acoustic pressure (in coupled acoustic-structural extractions) entry in each
675
*FREQUENCY

vector is unity. Displacement normalization is the default for both the subspace iteration eigensolver
and for the Lanczos eigensolver when you do not include the SIM parameter.
Set NORMALIZATION=MASS to normalize the eigenvectors with respect to the structure's mass
matrix (Abaqus/Standard scales the eigenvectors so that the generalized mass for each vector is
unity). Mass normalization is the default and only option available for the AMS eigensolver.
Abaqus/Standard switches on mass normalization for both the Lanczos eigensolver and the subspace
iteration eigensolver when you use them in conjunction with the default SIM parameter.
PROPERTY EVALUATION
Set this parameter equal to the frequency at which to evaluate frequency-dependent properties for
viscoelasticity, springs, and dashpots during the eigenvalue extraction. If you omit this parameter,
Abaqus/Standard evaluates the stiffness associated with frequency-dependent springs and dashpots
at zero frequency and does not consider the stiffness contributions from frequency domain
viscoelasticity in the *FREQUENCY step.
RESIDUAL MODES
This parameter is relevant only for the Lanczos and AMS eigensolvers.
Include this parameter to indicate that Abaqus/Standard should compute residual modes.
SIM
This parameter is relevant only for the Lanczos and subspace iteration eigensolvers.
Set the value of this parameter equal to NO if the non-SIM architecture is required for the Lanczos
or subspace iteration eigensolvers.
Set the value of this parameter equal to YES (default) if the SIM architecture is required.
The SIM architecture is the only option if the AMS eigensolver is activated.
Optional parameter when EIGENSOLVER=AMS:
NSET
Set this parameter equal to the name of the node set or include the parameter with no value to allow
Abaqus/Standard to automatically select the nodes at which to compute eigenvectors. If you omit
this parameter, Abaqus/Standard computes eigenvectors at all nodes.
Data line for a natural frequency extraction when EIGENSOLVER=LANCZOS:
First (and only) line:
1. Number of eigenvalues to calculate. You can leave this ﬁeld blank if you provide the maximum
frequency of interest and want to evaluate all the eigenvalues in the given range. You must
provide the number of requested eigenmodes in a cyclic symmetry analysis or if the analysis
includes more than one natural frequency extraction step.
2. Minimum frequency of interest, in cycles/time. If you leave this ﬁeld blank, Abaqus/Standard
does not set a minimum.
3. Maximum frequency of interest, in cycles/time. If you leave this ﬁeld blank, Abaqus/Standard
does not set a maximum. This value is required if you left the ﬁrst ﬁeld blank.
4. Shift point, in squared cycles per time (positive or negative). Abaqus/Standard extracts the
eigenvalues closest to this point.
5. Block size. If you omit this entry, Abaqus/Standard creates a default value, which is usually
appropriate.
6. Maximum number of block Lanczos steps within each Lanczos run. If you omit this entry,
Abaqus/Standard creates a default value, which is usually appropriate.

7. Acoustic range factor. This factor applies only to structural-acoustic problems and is used to set
the maximum frequency for the acoustic stage of the uncoupled eigenproblem as a multiple of
the nominal maximum frequency of interest. Abaqus/Standard supports this factor only when
using the SIM architecture and you provide the maximum frequency of interest. The acoustic
range factor must be greater than 0. The default value is 1.0.
Subsequent lines when default residual modes are not sufficient or you request residual modes:
1. Node number or node set label.
2. First degree of freedom for which residual modes are requested.
3. Last degree of freedom for which residual modes are requested. You can leave this ﬁeld blank

First (and only) line:
1. Number of eigenvalues to be calculated.
2. Maximum frequency of interest, in cycles/time. This user-speciﬁed maximum frequency is
increased automatically by 12.5% to help capture closely spaced modes. Abaqus/Standard also
reports all eigenvalues that converge in the same iteration as those in the speciﬁed range, even
if their frequencies are more than 12.5% above the maximum frequency speciﬁed by the user.
If you leave this ﬁeld blank, Abaqus/Standard does not set a maximum.
Abaqus/Standard extracts frequencies until either of the above limits is reached.

7. Shift point, in squared cycles per time (positive or negative). Abaqus/Standard extracts the
eigenvalues closest to this point.
9. Number of vectors used in the iteration. If you omit this entry, Abaqus/Standard creates a default
value, which is usually appropriate. The default number of vectors used is the minimum of (n+
8, 2n), where n is the number of eigenvalues requested (the ﬁrst data item on this data line). In
general, the convergence is more rapid with more vectors, but the memory requirement is also
larger. Therefore, if you know that a particular type of eigenproblem converges slowly, you
might reduce the analysis cost by providing more vectors.
11. Maximum number of iterations. The default is 30.

ELASTIC SLIP
This parameter applies only to Abaqus/Standard analyses.
In a steady-state transport analysis set this parameter equal to the absolute magnitude of the allowable
elastic slip velocity (
) to be used in the stiffness method for sticking friction. In all other analysis
procedures set this parameter equal to the absolute magnitude of the allowable elastic slip (
) to
be used in the stiffness method for sticking friction. If this parameter is omitted, the elastic slip (or
elastic slip velocity) is deﬁned by the SLIP TOLERANCE value.

for connector elements.
Include this parameter to choose the Lagrange multiplier formulation for friction.

velocity to angular velocity times the diameter of the spinning body in a steady-state transport
analysis or as the ratio of allowable maximum elastic slip to characteristic contact surface face
dimension in all other analysis procedures). The default is SLIP TOLERANCE=.005.
When friction is deﬁned for connector elements, 
 is deﬁned (when possible) as the ratio of
allowable maximum elastic slip to a characteristic element dimension in the model. In this case the
default is SLIP TOLERANCE=.0001.
USER
This parameter cannot be used when friction is deﬁned for connector elements.
In an Abaqus/Standard analysis, set USER=FRIC (default) if the friction model is to be deﬁned in
user subroutine FRIC. Set USER=COEFFICIENT if the friction coefﬁcient is to be deﬁned in user
subroutine FRIC_COEF.
In an Abaqus/Explicit analysis, set USER=FRIC (default) if the friction model is to be deﬁned in
user subroutine VFRIC. Set USER=FRICTION if the friction model is to be deﬁned in user subroutine
VFRICTION. VFRIC is applicable to contact pairs, whereas VFRICTION is applicable to general
contact. Set USER=COEFFICIENT if the friction coefﬁcient is to be deﬁned in user subroutine
VFRIC_COEF. VFRIC_COEF can be used only with general contact.
Optional parameters:
ANISOTROPIC BEHAVIOR
If this parameter is omitted in an Abaqus/Standard analysis and the USER parameter is included,
the user subroutine determines whether directional preference exists in resistance to sliding.
Otherwise, the friction model remains isotropic.
If this parameter is omitted in an Abaqus/Explicit analysis, anisotropic frictional behavior occurs
if directional preference is speciﬁed as a surface property.
Set ANISOTROPIC BEHAVIOR=LEGACY to specify anisotropic friction with directional preference
associated with a contact orientation. This parameter value applies only to Abaqus/Standard analyses
and cannot apply to friction associated with connector elements.
Set ANISOTROPIC BEHAVIOR=NONE to specify that the friction model remains isotropic, even
if directional preference is assigned as a surface property.
Set ANISOTROPIC BEHAVIOR=SURFACE PROPERTY to allow anisotropic frictional behavior
to occur if directional preference is speciﬁed as a surface property. This parameter value applies
only to Abaqus/Explicit analyses.
COEFFICIENT PRECEDENCE
This parameter applies only to Abaqus/Explicit analyses and is used to control the precedence of
specifying friction coefﬁcients.
Set COEFFICIENT PRECEDENCE=CONTACT PROPERTY (default) to indicate that friction
coefﬁcients assigned as contact properties take precedence over friction coefﬁcients derived from
values speciﬁed as surface properties.
Set COEFFICIENT PRECEDENCE=SURFACE PROPERTY COMBINATION to indicate that
friction coefﬁcients derived from values speciﬁed as surface properties take precedence over friction
coefﬁcients assigned as contact properties.

DEPENDENCIES
Set this parameter equal to the number of ﬁeld variable dependencies included in the deﬁnition of
the friction coefﬁcient in addition to slip rate, contact pressure, and temperature. If this parameter
is omitted, it is assumed that the friction coefﬁcients have no dependencies or depend only on slip
rate, contact pressure, and temperature. See Material Data Deﬁnition for more information.

transition zone deﬁned by an exponential curve.

PROPERTIES=0.
SHEAR TRACTION SLOPE
This parameter applies only to Abaqus/Explicit analyses.
Set this parameter equal to the slope of the curve that deﬁnes the shear traction as a function of the
elastic slip between the two surfaces. If this parameter is omitted or frictional forces are not present,
shear softening will not be activated. This parameter cannot be used in conjunction with user
subroutines VFRIC, VFRIC_COEF, and VFRICTION.
TAUMAX
Set this parameter equal to the equivalent shear stress limit; that is, the maximum achievable value
of the equivalent shear stress. The value given must be greater than zero.
TEST DATA
This parameter is valid only if the EXPONENTIAL DECAY parameter is used.
Include this parameter if the exponential decay coefﬁcient,

Optional parameters:
HEAT
This parameter is relevant if there are regions in the model that use coupled temperature–pore
pressure elements; it speciﬁes whether heat transfer effects are to be modeled in these regions.

Set SLURRY FLOW=YES (default) to activate the solution of the slurry continuity equation in a
step. In this case, the slurry concentration ﬁeld will evolve with time within the step.
Set SLURRY FLOW=NO to deactivate the solution of the slurry continuity equation in a step. In
this case, the slurry concentration ﬁeld will not evolve with time within the step.
This parameter is relevant only when the slurry concentration degree of freedom is active.

Optional parameters:
DELTMX
This parameter applies only to Abaqus/Standard analyses.
Set this parameter equal to the maximum temperature change to be allowed in an increment during
a transient heat transfer analysis. Abaqus/Standard will restrict the time step to ensure that this value
will not be exceeded at any node (except nodes whose temperature degree of freedom is constrained
via boundary conditions, MPC's, etc.) during any increment of the step. If the DELTMX parameter
is omitted, ﬁxed time increments will be used.
END
This parameter applies only to Abaqus/Standard analyses.
Set END=PERIOD (default) to analyze a speciﬁc time period. Set END=SS to end the analysis
when steady state is reached.
This parameter is relevant only for transient analysis.
STEADY STATE
Include this parameter to choose steady-state analysis. Transient analysis is assumed if this parameter
is omitted.
Optional parameter for cavity radiation analysis:
MXDEM
This parameter applies only to Abaqus/Standard analyses.
Set this parameter equal to the maximum allowable emissivity change with temperature and ﬁeld
variables during an increment. If this value is exceeded, Abaqus/Standard will cut back the increment
until the maximum change in emissivity is less than the speciﬁed value. If this parameter is omitted,

*HEAT TRANSFER

Data line to control incrementation and steady-state conditions in a pure heat transfer analysis:
First (and only) line:
1. Initial time increment. If automatic incrementation is used, this should be a reasonable suggestion
for the initial increment size and will be adjusted as necessary. If direct incrementation is used,
this will be the ﬁxed time increment size.
2. Total time period. If END=SS is chosen, the step ends when steady state is reached or after this
time period, whichever occurs ﬁrst.
3. Minimum time increment allowed. If Abaqus/Standard ﬁnds it needs a smaller time increment
than this value, the analysis is terminated. If a value is given, Abaqus/Standard will use the
minimum of the given value and 0.8 times the initial time increment. If no value is given,
Abaqus/Standard sets the minimum increment to the minimum of 0.8 times the initial time
increment (ﬁrst data item on this data line) and 1×10-5 times the total time period (second data
item on this data line). This value is used only for automatic time incrementation.
4. Maximum time increment allowed. If this value is not speciﬁed, no upper limit is imposed. This
value is used only for automatic time incrementation.
5. Temperature change rate (temperature per time) used to deﬁne steady state; only needed if
END=SS is chosen. When all nodal temperatures are changing at less than this rate, the solution
terminates.

an hourglass scaling factor for the stiffness associated with the drill degree of freedom (rotation about the surface
normal) in shell elements and to modify the hourglass stiffness factor for the pressure Lagrange multiplier degrees
of freedom for C3D4H elements.

1. Hourglass control stiffness parameter 
 for use with membrane and solid elements and for

entered as zero, Abaqus/Standard will use the default value.
2. Hourglass control stiffness parameter 
 for use with element type C3D4H. Units of this
parameter depend on the material property assigned to the element. For nearly incompressible
elastomers (*HYPERELASTIC) and elastometric foams (*HYPERFOAM) the units are stress

are stress compliance (F−1L2). If this value is left blank or entered as zero, Abaqus/Standard will
use the default value.
3. Hourglass control stiffness parameter (
) for bending hourglass mode control in shells. Units
are stress (FL−2). If this value is left blank or entered as zero, Abaqus/Standard will use the
default value.
4. Factor by which the default stiffness for rotation about the shell surface normal is to be scaled

Optional parameters (mutually exclusive—if neither parameter is specified, Abaqus assumes
that the imperfection data will be entered directly on the data lines):
FILE
Set this parameter equal to the name of the results (.fil) ﬁle or an output database (.odb or
.sim) ﬁle from a previous Abaqus/Standard analysis containing either the mode shapes from a
*BUCKLE or *FREQUENCY analysis or the nodal displacements from a *STATIC analysis. The
ﬁle extension is optional. However, if both a results ﬁle and output database ﬁle exist, the results
ﬁle is used. If there is no results ﬁle but both the .odb and .sim ﬁles exist, the .odb ﬁle is used.
INPUT
Set this parameter equal to the name of the alternate input ﬁle containing the imperfection data, in
general, as the node number and imperfection values in the global coordinate system. See Input
Syntax Rules for the syntax of such ﬁle names.
Required parameter if the FILE parameter is used:
STEP
Set this parameter equal to the step number (in the analysis whose ﬁle is being used as input to this
option) from which the modal or displacement data are to be read.
Optional parameters if the FILE parameter is used:
INC
Set this parameter equal to the increment number (in the analysis whose ﬁle is being used as input
to this option) from which the displacement data are to be read. If this parameter is omitted, Abaqus
will read the data from the last increment available for the speciﬁed step in the results or output
database ﬁle.
NSET
Set this parameter equal to the node set to which the geometric imperfection values are to be applied.
If this parameter is omitted, the imperfection will be applied to all nodes in the model.

*IMPERFECTION

Optional parameter if the FILE parameter is omitted:
SYSTEM
Set SYSTEM=R (default) to specify the imperfection as perturbation values of Cartesian coordinates.
Set SYSTEM=C to specify the imperfection as perturbation values of cylindrical coordinates. Set
SYSTEM=S to specify the imperfection as perturbation values of spherical coordinates. See Figure
1.
The SYSTEM parameter is entirely local to this option and should not be confused with the *SYSTEM
option. As the data lines are read, the imperfection values speciﬁed are transformed to the global
rectangular Cartesian coordinate system. This transformation requires that the object be centered
about the origin of the global coordinate system; i.e., the *SYSTEM option should be off when
specifying imperfections as perturbation values using either cylindrical or spherical coordinates.

file:
First line:
1. Mode number.
2. Scaling factor for this mode.

*IMPORT: Import information from a previous Abaqus/Explicit or
Abaqus/Standard analysis.
This option is used to deﬁne the time in a previous Abaqus/Standard or Abaqus/Explicit analysis at which the
speciﬁed node and element information is imported. The *IMPORT option must be used in conjunction with
the *INSTANCE option when importing a part instance from a previous analysis.
You can deﬁne new positions for the imported elements and import an element or a part instance more than
once. In an Abaqus/Explicit import analysis you can also import element sets and part instances from multiple
previous analyses.
You can use the full-model input format to specify that all import model data (including elements and nodes,
element sets and node sets, sections and materials, etc.) are given in the input. The full-model input format is
speciﬁed in the *IMPORT CONTROLS option. This format cannot be used in conjunction with the *INSTANCE
option.
Products:
Abaqus/Standard
Abaqus/Explicit
Abaqus/CAE
Type:  Model data
Level:  Part instance
Abaqus/CAE: Supported for use in conjunction with part instances; importing selected part instances stored
in an output database is supported using the File menu and importing the initial state of part instances is supported
in the Load module.
References:
• About Transferring Results between Abaqus Analyses

Required parameters:
UPDATE
Set UPDATE=NO to continue the analysis without resetting the reference conﬁguration.
Set UPDATE=YES to continue the analysis by resetting the reference conﬁguration to be the
imported conﬁguration. In this case displacement and strain values are calculated from the new
reference conﬁguration.
Required parameters if the imported elements are to be renamed (not applicable for import of
part instances):
EOFFSET
Set this parameter equal to an integer that speciﬁes the offset to be used to renumber the imported
elements.
If you use the full-model input format, you must number the elements for the imported element sets
input in the data lines below by their numbers in the previous analysis plus the value assigned to
the EOFFSET parameter.
NOFFSET
Set this parameter equal to an integer that speciﬁes the offset to be used to renumber the imported
nodes.
Abaqus Keywords Guide
746
*IMPORT

If you use the full-model input format, you must number the nodes for the imported node sets input
in the data lines below by their numbers in the previous analysis plus the value assigned to the
NOFFSET parameter.
RENAME
Include this parameter to specify new labels for the element sets to be imported from the previous
analysis.
This parameter is not applicable if you use the full-model input format because the names of the
imported element sets are given in the input.
Required parameter if importing from multiple previous analyses (Abaqus/Explicit only; not
applicable for import of part instances) or if the full-model input format is used; optional
parameter if importing from a single analysis:
LIBRARY
Set this parameter equal to a value that speciﬁes the previous analysis from which to import the
element sets. You can specify the name of the previous analysis or the name including a full path.
If no path is speciﬁed, all input ﬁles and results ﬁles from the previous analyses must reside in the
current (working) directory.
When importing from a single previous analysis, if the LIBRARY parameter is omitted, you must
specify the job name of the previous analysis in the command line using the oldjob option. If both
methods are used, the LIBRARY parameter takes precedence over the command line speciﬁcation.
When importing from multiple previous analyses or when the full-model input format is speciﬁed,
set this parameter equal to the job name. In this case, you should not use the oldjob option on the
command line.
Optional parameters:
INCREMENT
When importing an analysis from Abaqus/Standard, set this parameter equal to the increment of the
speciﬁed step on the Abaqus/Standard restart ﬁle from which the analysis is to be imported. If this
parameter is omitted, the analysis is imported from the last available increment of the speciﬁed step.
The INCREMENT, INTERVAL, and ITERATION parameters are mutually exclusive.
INTERVAL
When importing an analysis from Abaqus/Explicit, set this parameter equal to the interval of the
speciﬁed step on the Abaqus/Explicit state ﬁle from which the analysis is to be imported. If this
parameter is omitted, the analysis is imported from the last available interval of the speciﬁed step.
The INCREMENT, INTERVAL, and ITERATION parameters are mutually exclusive.
ITERATION
This parameter is relevant only when the results are imported from a previous direct cyclic
Abaqus/Standard analysis.
Set this parameter equal to the iteration number of the speciﬁed step on the Abaqus/Standard restart
ﬁle from which the analysis is to be imported. Since restart information can be written only at the
end of an iteration in a direct cyclic analysis, the INCREMENT parameter is irrelevant and is ignored
if the ITERATION parameter is speciﬁed. If this parameter is omitted, the analysis is imported from
the last available iteration of the speciﬁed step.
The INCREMENT, INTERVAL, and ITERATION parameters are mutually exclusive.
STATE
747
Abaqus Keywords Guide
*IMPORT

Set STATE=YES (default) to import the current material state of the elements at the speciﬁed step
and the speciﬁed interval, increment, or iteration.
Set STATE=NO if no material state is to be imported. In this case the elements start with no initial
state or with the state as deﬁned by the *INITIAL CONDITIONS option.
STEP
Set this parameter equal to the step number on the Abaqus/Explicit state ﬁle or on the
Abaqus/Standard restart ﬁle from which the analysis is being imported.
If both the STEP and STEP NAME parameters are omitted, the analysis is imported from the last
available step on the state ﬁle or the restart ﬁle at the speciﬁed increment, interval, or iteration.
The STEP and STEP NAME parameters are mutually exclusive.
STEP NAME
Set this parameter equal to the step name on the Abaqus/Explicit state ﬁle or on the Abaqus/Standard
restart ﬁle from which the analysis is being imported. This parameter value is case sensitive.
If both the STEP and STEP NAME parameters are omitted, the analysis is imported from the last
available step on the state ﬁle or the restart ﬁle at the speciﬁed increment, interval, or iteration.
The STEP and STEP NAME parameters are mutually exclusive.
Data lines to specify the elements to be imported and optionally repositioned:
First line if the RENAME parameter is not specified:
1. List of element sets that are to be imported. Specify only element set names that are used in the

Set TYPE=ACTIVATION to deﬁne the initial volume fraction for elements used in progressive
element activation in an Abaqus/Standard analysis. The value of the volume fraction must be equal

Set TYPE=CONTACT to specify initial bonded contact conditions on part of the secondary surface

this parameter when CRITERION=DUCTILE or CRITERION=SHEAR.
Set TYPE=ENRICHMENT to specify initial location of an enriched feature, such as a crack, in an

the crack location, including the location of crack tips, in a cracked geometry. The ﬁrst describes
the crack surface while the second is used to construct an orthogonal surface so that the intersection

used with this parameter. If the USER parameter is used, the initial conditions on equivalent plastic
strain and, if relevant, the backstress tensor must be speciﬁed via user subroutine HARDINI for each
section point and for each rebar. Consequently, in this case the REBAR and SECTION POINTS
parameters do not have any effect and are ignored. If the USER parameter is omitted,
Abaqus/Standard assumes that the initial conditions are deﬁned on the data lines.

account for deformation from the reference to the initial conﬁguration.
Set TYPE=PLASTIC STRAIN to specify initial plastic strains. The SECTION POINTS and REBAR

Set TYPE=PORE PRESSURE to give initial pore ﬂuid pressures for a coupled pore ﬂuid
diffusion/stress analysis in Abaqus/Standard. The STEP and INC parameters can also be used with
the FILE parameter to deﬁne initial values of pore ﬂuid pressures based on scalar nodal output

ﬂuid pressures for an undrained pore ﬂuid ﬂow and stress analysis.
Set TYPE=POROSITY to give initial porosity values for materials deﬁned with the *EOS
COMPACTION option in Abaqus/Explicit, materials deﬁned using the poroelastic acoustic models
in Abaqus/Standard, or modiﬁed Drucker-Prager/Cap plasticity materials. In Abaqus/Explicit, you
can also specify initial porosity values in an undrained pore ﬂuid ﬂow and stress analysis. In
Abaqus/Standard, you can specify initial porosity values in a coupled
thermal-electrochemical-structural–pore pressure analysis.
Set TYPE=PRESSURE STRESS to give initial pressure stresses for a mass diffusion analysis in

to deﬁne initial values of pressure stress from the results (.fil) ﬁle of a previous Abaqus/Standard

for the same element. The initial stress and strain are computed automatically to account for
deformation from the reference to the initial conﬁguration.
Set TYPE=RELATIVE DENSITY to give initial relative density values for materials deﬁned with
the *POROUS METAL PLASTICITY option.
Set TYPE=ROTATING VELOCITY to prescribe initial velocities in terms of an angular velocity
and a global translational velocity.
Set TYPE=SATURATION to give initial saturation values for the analysis of ﬂow through a porous
medium in Abaqus/Standard. If no initial saturation values are given on this option, the default is
fully saturated conditions (saturation of 1.0). For partial saturation the initial saturation and the pore
ﬂuid pressure must be consistent in the sense that the pore ﬂuid pressure must lie within the range
of absorption and exsorption values for the initial saturation value. If this is not the case,
Abaqus/Standard will adjust the saturation value as needed to satisfy this requirement.
Set TYPE=SLURRYVF to give initial slurry concentration in a geotechnical analysis that models

the *EOS option in Abaqus/Explicit.
Set TYPE=SPUD EMBEDMENT to give the initial embedment for a spud can in an Abaqus/Aqua

Set TYPE=SPUD PRELOAD to give the initial preload value for a spud can in an Abaqus/Aqua

Set TYPE=STRESS to give initial stresses. (These stresses are effective stresses when the analysis
includes pore ﬂuid ﬂow.) The GEOSTATIC; the REBAR; the SECTION POINTS; and, in
Abaqus/Standard, the USER parameters can be used with this parameter. If TYPE=STRESS is used
without the USER parameter, it is assumed that the stress components are deﬁned on each data line
in the order given for the element type, as deﬁned in About the Element Library. The STEP and
INC parameters can also be used with the FILE parameter to deﬁne initial stress values based on
stress output variables read from an output database (.odb or .sim) ﬁle.

This parameter is used to eliminate mapping ambiguity in cases where element regions in the previous
analysis are close or touching. To accomplish part instance to part instance mapping, deﬁne your
element and node sets to correspond to the respective instances in the previous and current analysis.
EXTERIOR TOLERANCE
This parameter is relevant only for use with the INTERPOLATE parameter. Set this parameter equal
to the fraction of the average element size by which nodes of the current model may lie outside the
region of the elements of the model in the output database speciﬁed by the FILE parameter. The
default value is 0.05.
If both tolerance parameters are speciﬁed, Abaqus uses the tighter tolerance.

*INITIAL CONDITIONS

FILE
Set this parameter equal to the name of the results (.fil) ﬁle or output database (.odb) ﬁle from
which initial ﬁeld variable, void ratio, pore pressure, or pressure stress data are to be read.
Set this parameter equal to the name of output database (.odb or .sim) ﬁle from which initial
stress is to be read.
This parameter must be used in conjunction with the STEP and INC parameters. For more
information, see File Extension Deﬁnitions.
This parameter is ignored if the initial ﬁeld values are speciﬁed with the *EXTERNAL FIELD option.
FULL TENSOR
Include this parameter if the kinematic shift tensor (backstress) components are speciﬁed using the
full tensor format, regardless of the element type to which the initial conditions are applied.
This parameter can be used only in conjunction with the parameter TYPE=HARDENING. It cannot
be used if any of the parameters REBAR, SECTION POINTS, or USER has been used.
GEOSTATIC
This parameter is used only with TYPE=STRESS to specify that a geostatic stress state, in which
stresses vary with elevation only, is being deﬁned.
INC
This parameter is used only with the FILE parameter. If this parameter is omitted, the initial conditions
will be read from the last increment of the step speciﬁed on the STEP parameter or from the last
step if the STEP parameter is omitted.
The parameter speciﬁes the increment in the results (.fil) ﬁle of a previous Abaqus analysis from
which prescribed ﬁelds of TYPE=FIELD, TYPE=PRESSURE STRESS, or TYPE=TEMPERATURE
are to be read. It can also specify the increment in the output database (.odb) ﬁle of a previous
Abaqus analysis from which prescribed ﬁelds of TYPE=FIELD, TYPE=PORE PRESSURE,
TYPE=RATIO, or TYPE=TEMPERATURE are to be read. For TYPE=STRESS, this parameter
speciﬁes the increment in the output database (.odb or .sim) ﬁle of a previous Abaqus analysis
from which initial stress is to be read.
INPUT
Set this parameter equal to the name of the alternate input ﬁle containing the data lines for this
option. See Input Syntax Rules for the syntax of such ﬁle names. If this parameter is omitted, it is
assumed that the data follow the keyword line.
INTERPOLATE
Include this parameter in conjunction with the FILE, STEP, and INC parameters to indicate that the
nodal temperatures being read into the temperature ﬁeld or the scalar nodal output variable being
read into a predeﬁned ﬁeld needs to be interpolated between dissimilar meshes. This feature is used
to read nodal values from an output database (.odb) ﬁle generated during a previous Abaqus
analysis.
For void ratio initialization from a previous output database ﬁle, this parameter is automatically
activated and the old void ratios from either the element integration points or the element nodes are
read and mapped onto the current nodes.
For temperature ﬁelds this parameter and the MIDSIDE parameter are mutually exclusive. For
temperature ﬁelds if the initial analysis uses ﬁrst-order elements and the current mesh is the same
but uses second-order elements, use the MIDSIDE parameter instead. The MIDSIDE parameter is
not supported for predeﬁned ﬁelds; therefore, the INTERPOLATE parameter is the only option for
initializing predeﬁned ﬁelds using scalar nodal output values from a dissimilar mesh.

*INITIAL CONDITIONS

MIDSIDE
This parameter applies only to Abaqus/Standard analyses.
Include this parameter in conjunction with the FILE, STEP, and INC parameters to indicate that
midside node temperatures in second-order elements are to be interpolated from corner node
temperatures. This feature is used to read temperatures from a results (.fil) or output database
(.odb) ﬁle generated during a heat transfer analysis using ﬁrst-order elements. This parameter and
the INTERPOLATE parameter are mutually exclusive.
NORMAL
This parameter applies only to Abaqus/Standard analyses.
This parameter can be used only with TYPE=CONTACT to specify that the nodes in the node set
(or the contact pair, if a node set is not deﬁned) are bonded only in the normal (contact) direction
and are allowed to move freely in the tangential direction. If the nodes in the node set (or the contact
pair) are to be bonded in all directions, this parameter should be omitted.
NUMBER BACKSTRESSES
Set this parameter equal to the number of backstresses. This parameter can be used only in conjunction
with TYPE=HARDENING. The default number of backstresses is 0 if the initial conditions are
deﬁned with the *EXTERNAL FIELD option; otherwise, the default number is 1. The maximum
allowed is 10.
OUTPUT VARIABLE
This parameter is required when TYPE=FIELD and the FILE parameter references an output
database.
Set this parameter equal to the scalar nodal output variable that will be read from an output database
and used to initialize a speciﬁed predeﬁned ﬁeld. For a list of scalar nodal output variables that can
be used to initialize a predeﬁned ﬁeld, see Predeﬁned Fields.
REBAR
This parameter can be used with TYPE=DAMAGE INITIATION, TYPE=HARDENING,
TYPE=PLASTIC STRAIN, TYPE=SOLUTION, or TYPE=STRESS.
When used with TYPE=DAMAGE INITIATION, it speciﬁes the initial value of the damage initiation
measure in the rebar.
When used with TYPE=HARDENING, it speciﬁes that rebars are in a work hardened state, with
initial equivalent plastic strain and, possibly, initial backstress.
When used with TYPE=PLASTIC STRAIN, it speciﬁes the initial plastic strain in the rebar.
When used with TYPE=SOLUTION, it speciﬁes that rebars are being assigned initial
solution-dependent state variable values.
When used with TYPE=STRESS, it speciﬁes that prestress in rebars is being deﬁned. When
performing an Abaqus/Standard analysis, some iteration will usually be needed in this case to
establish a self-equilibrating stress state in the rebar and concrete. The *PRESTRESS HOLD option
can be useful for post-tensioning simulations (see Deﬁning Rebar as an Element Property).
SECTION POINTS
This parameter is used only with TYPE=DAMAGE INITIATION, TYPE=HARDENING,
TYPE=PLASTIC STRAIN, and TYPE=STRESS to specify damage initiation measures, hardening
variables, plastic strains, and stresses at individual section points through the thickness of a shell
element. This parameter can be used only when shell properties are deﬁned using the *SHELL
SECTION option. It cannot be used when properties are deﬁned using the *SHELL GENERAL
SECTION option.

STEP
This parameter is used only with the FILE parameter. If this parameter is omitted, the initial conditions
will be read from the last step.
The parameter speciﬁes the step in the results (.fil) ﬁle of a previous Abaqus analysis from which
prescribed ﬁelds of TYPE=FIELD, TYPE=PRESSURE STRESS, or TYPE=TEMPERATURE are
to be read. It can also specify the step in the output database (.odb) ﬁle of a previous Abaqus
analysis from which prescribed ﬁelds of TYPE=FIELD, TYPE=PORE PRESSURE, TYPE=RATIO,
or TYPE=TEMPERATURE are to be read. For TYPE=STRESS, this parameter speciﬁes the step
in the output database (.odb or .sim) ﬁle of a previous Abaqus analysis from which initial stress
is to be read.
UNBALANCED STRESS
This parameter applies only to Abaqus/Standard analyses.
This parameter is used only with TYPE=STRESS.
Set UNBALANCED STRESS=RAMP (default) if the unbalanced stress is to be resolved linearly
over the step.
Set UNBALANCED STRESS=STEP if the unbalanced stress is to be resolved in the ﬁrst increment.
If the *INITIAL CONDITIONS option is repeated multiple times in an input ﬁle, the UNBALANCED
STRESS parameter setting on the last occurrence prevails.
USER
In Abaqus/Standard, this parameter can be used with TYPE=HARDENING, TYPE=PORE
PRESSURE, TYPE=RATIO, TYPE=SOLUTION, or TYPE=STRESS.
When used with TYPE=HARDENING, it speciﬁes that the initial conditions on equivalent plastic
strain and, if relevant, backstress tensor are to be given via user subroutine HARDINI.
When used with TYPE=PORE PRESSURE, it speciﬁes that initial pore pressures are to be given
via user subroutine UPOREP.

of this material is present in the element, while EVF=1.0 indicates that the element is completely
full of this material.
Repeat this data line as often as necessary to define the initial geometry of all Eulerian material
instances. An element might appear in more than one data line if it initially contains more than one
material. Elements are filled incrementally by reading the data lines in the input file from bottom to top;
once the volume fraction for an element reaches one, additional volume fractions assigned to that
element are ignored. If the final volume fraction for an element is less than one, the remainder of that
element is filled with void; similarly, uninitialized elements are filled with void.

Optional parameters:

Set this parameter equal to the

when used in direct-integration dynamic analyses, in mode-based analyses that support nondiagonal
damping in Abaqus/Standard, and in explicit dynamic analyses. This value is ignored in mode-based

*MASS ADJUST: Adjust and/or redistribute the mass of an element set.
This option is used to increase or decrease the mass of the elements in an element set uniformly so that the total
mass for that set matches a speciﬁed value. It can also be used to redistribute the mass among the elements in
the element set to raise the minimum stable time increment for that set to a speciﬁed target value.
The total mass of an element set can also be increased or decreased using a scale factor. When using a scale
factor, the total mass of the elements in the element set can be redistributed to reach the maximum time target
for the set or only the added mass can be redistributed (the pre-adjusted mass of the elements is preserved).
Mass can be adjusted for multiple element sets; the mass is adjusted in the order in which the element sets are
speciﬁed. This behavior inﬂuences the ﬁnal outcome for element sets that share elements.
This option can appear only once in an analysis.

Optional parameters:
TARGET DT
Set this parameter equal to a value to deﬁne a default minimum element stable time increment for
all of the mass-adjusted element sets. Target time increments can be speciﬁed for selected sets on
the data lines, if needed. A nonzero target value causes redistribution of mass within the element
sets.
Set TARGET DT=MAXIMIZE to indicate that a maximum possible time increment for the elements
in the sets is desired. The mass redistribution to maximize the time increment can be done for the
total mass or for only the added mass. Maximizing the time increment can be speciﬁed for selected
sets on the data lines, if needed.
If this parameter is omitted, the third ﬁeld in the data lines speciﬁes the redistribution behavior.
Data lines to adjust and/or redistribute the mass of element sets:
First line:
1. Element set label.
2. Total mass of the element set. Enter the mass value, or enter CURRENT to redistribute the mass
to achieve a target time increment without altering the total mass.
3. Enter the minimum element stable time increment value for the element set. If using a scale
factor, enter MAXIMIZE to maximize the minimum stable time increment in the initial
conﬁguration or enter UNIFORM to distribute the mass in proportion with the pre-adjusted
mass. If omitted, the default value is the setting of the TARGET DT parameter if it is used;
otherwise, the default value for the minimum element stable time increment is 0.0 or, if using a
scale factor, the default behavior is to distribute the mass in proportion with the pre-adjusted
mass. When both the TARGET DT parameter and a data line entry for the element set are
speciﬁed, the data line entry for the element set is used for that set.

4. Mass scale factor for the element set. Only relevant for redistributing mass to achieve a maximum
possible time increment in the element set and distributing the mass in proportion with the

5. Enter REDIST to indicate that the total element mass (the pre-adjusted mass plus the added
mass) should be redistributed. Enter ADD to indicate that only the added mass should be
redistributed. Only relevant for redistributing mass to achieve a maximum possible time increment

Optional parameters:
DCMAX
Set this parameter equal to the maximum normalized concentration change to be allowed in an

at any node (except nodes with boundary conditions) during any increment of the analysis. If the
DCMAX parameter is omitted, ﬁxed time increments will be used.
END
Set END=PERIOD (default) to analyze the entire time period speciﬁed on the data line. Set END=SS

STEADY STATE
Include this parameter to choose steady-state analysis. Transient analysis is assumed if this parameter
is omitted.
Data line to define time stepping in a mass diffusion analysis:
First (and only) line:
1. Time step. If automatic stepping is used, this value should be a reasonable suggestion for the
initial step and will be adjusted as necessary.
2. Time period. If END=SS is chosen, the step ends when steady state is reached or after this time
period, whichever occurs ﬁrst.
3. Minimum time increment allowed. If Abaqus/Standard ﬁnds it needs a smaller time increment
than this value, the analysis is terminated. If no value is given, Abaqus/Standard sets the minimum
increment to the minimum of 0.8 times the suggested initial time step (the ﬁrst data item on this
line) and 10−5 times the time period (the second data item on this line). If a value is given,
Abaqus/Standard will use the minimum of the given value and 0.8 times the suggested initial
time step.
4. Maximum time increment. If this value is omitted, no upper limit is imposed. This value is used
only for automatic time incrementation.
5. Rate of change of normalized concentration (normalized concentration per time) used to deﬁne
steady state; only needed if END=SS is chosen. When all nodal normalized concentrations are
changing at less than this rate, the solution terminates.

Abaqus/CAE: Not applicable; nodes are generated when you mesh the model.
References:
• Node Deﬁnition
Optional parameters:
BIAS
Include this parameter to bias the spacing of the nodes being generated toward one end of the line
of nodes being generated. Set this parameter equal to the ratio of adjacent distances between nodes
along each line of nodes generated, as the nodes go from the ﬁrst bounding node set to the second.
If the BIAS parameter is less than one, the nodes are concentrated toward the ﬁrst bounding node
set; if it is greater than one, the nodes are concentrated toward the second bounding set. The value
of the parameter must be positive.
The BIAS and SINGULAR parameters are mutually exclusive.
NSET
Set this parameter equal to the name of the node set to which the nodes created by this operation
(including the bounding nodes) will be assigned. Node sets generated by this option are always
sorted node sets.
SINGULAR
This parameter applies only to Abaqus/Standard analyses.
Include this parameter for fracture mechanics calculations with second-order isoparametric elements
to create a “quarter point” crack-tip element and bias the remaining elements. Set SINGULAR=1
or 2, depending on whether the ﬁrst or the second bounding node set represents the crack tip.
The BIAS and SINGULAR parameters are mutually exclusive.
TWO STEP
This parameter is meaningful only if the BIAS parameter is used. When this parameter is included,
the BIAS value is applied only at each second interval along the line; therefore, the midside nodes
of second-order elements will be at the middle of the two adjacent intervals.
Data lines to fill in nodes between two bounds:
First line:
1. Name of the node set deﬁning the ﬁrst bound of the region.
2. Name of the node set deﬁning the second bound of the region.

the members of the element set region in proportion to the element volume in the initial conﬁguration.
A uniform value is added to the underlying structural density over the element set region; therefore,

be altered.

*OPERATOR OUTPUT

*ORIENTATION: Define a local axis system for material or element property
definition, for kinematic coupling constraints, for free directions for inertia
relief loads, or for connectors.
This option is used to deﬁne a local coordinate system for deﬁnition of material properties; for material calculations
at integration points; for element property deﬁnitions (for example, connector elements); for output of components
of stress, strain, and element section forces; and for kinematic and distributing coupling constraints. A spatially
varying local coordinate system can be deﬁned for solid continuum elements and shell elements using distributions
(Distribution Deﬁnition).
The *ORIENTATION option can also be used to specify local material directions for anisotropic hyperelastic
materials with invariant-based formulation (Invariant-Based Formulation). The local directions are deﬁned with
respect to the local coordinate system.
In Abaqus/Explicit the *ORIENTATION option can be used to:
•
specify ﬁber dispersion for multiscale materials (Specifying a Second-Order Orientation Tensor in
Abaqus/Explicit) or linear short-ﬁber reinforced composite materials (Deﬁning the Elasticity of a Short-Fiber
Reinforced Composite), and
•
initialize the directions of the ﬁll and the warp yarns of a fabric material in the reference conﬁguration. The
yarn directions lying in the plane of the fabric are deﬁned with respect to the two in-plane axes of the
orthogonal coordinate system.
In Abaqus/Standard the *ORIENTATION option can be used to deﬁne local directions for contact pair interaction
properties and spring, dashpot, and JOINTC elements; for deﬁnition of local free directions for inertia relief
loads; and for output of components of surface variables.

Required parameters:
NAME
Set this parameter equal to a label that will be used to refer to the orientation deﬁnition. Orientation
names in the same input ﬁle must be unique.
Optional parameters:
DEFINITION
Set DEFINITION=COORDINATES (default) to deﬁne the local system by giving the coordinates
of the three points a, b, and, optionally, c (the origin) appropriate to the SYSTEM choice from
Figure 1. A spatially varying local coordinate system can be created for this parameter value by
using a distribution to deﬁne the spatially varying coordinates for points a and b. Using a distribution
to deﬁne the coordinates of the optional point c is not supported. See Distribution Deﬁnition.
937
*ORIENTATION

Set DEFINITION=NODES to deﬁne the local system by giving global node numbers for points a,
b, and, optionally, c (the origin).
Set DEFINITION=OFFSET TO NODES to deﬁne the local system by giving local node numbers
(on the element where the orientation is being used) to deﬁne the points a, b, and, optionally, c (the
origin) in Figure 1. This parameter value cannot be used with spring, dashpot, or JOINTC elements.
In addition, it cannot be used with the *KINEMATIC COUPLING, *INERTIA RELIEF, or *CONTACT
PAIR options.
For all DEFINITION parameter values a spatially varying local coordinate system can be created
for solid continuum elements and shell elements by using a distribution to deﬁne a spatially varying
additional rotation angle . See Distribution Deﬁnition.
DISPERSION
This parameter is relevant only for multiscale materials with dispersed ﬁber directions or linear
elastic materials with ﬁber dispersion speciﬁed.
Include this parameter to specify the second-order tensor for the ﬁber dispersion. The dispersed
ﬁber direction is speciﬁed in the material deﬁnition.
If no dispersion is speciﬁed as part of the orientation deﬁnition, the orientation tensor speciﬁed in
the material deﬁnition is used. Otherwise, the orientation tensor speciﬁed in the orientation deﬁnition
overrides the values speciﬁed in the material deﬁnition.
LOCAL DIRECTIONS
This parameter is relevant only for anisotropic materials with preferred material directions (or ﬁber
directions), such as anisotropic hyperelastic materials or, in Abaqus/Explicit, fabric materials.
Set this parameter equal to the number of local directions that are applicable to the material model
(for example, two for a fabric material). The local directions are speciﬁed with respect to the
orthonormal system at the material point resulting from the current orientation deﬁnition. Up to
three local directions can be speciﬁed as part of the deﬁnition of a local orientation system.
For the fabric material in Abaqus/Explicit, the two yarn directions are given with respect to the
in-plane axes of the orthonormal system. If no local directions are speciﬁed as part of the orientation
deﬁnition, the local material directions are assumed to match the in-plane axes of the orthonormal
system in the reference conﬁguration.
SYSTEM
Set SYSTEM=RECTANGULAR (default) to deﬁne a rectangular Cartesian system by the three
points a, b, and c shown in Figure 1. Point c is the origin of the system, point a must lie on the
-axis, and point b must lie on the 
-
 plane. Although not required, it is intuitive to select
point b such that it is on or near the local 
-axis.
Set SYSTEM=CYLINDRICAL to deﬁne a cylindrical system by giving the two points a and b on
the polar axis of the cylindrical system (Figure 1). The local axes are 1=radial, 2=circumferential,
3=axial.
Set SYSTEM=SPHERICAL to deﬁne a spherical system by giving the center of the sphere, a, and
point b on the polar axis (Figure 1). The local axes are 1=radial, 2=circumferential, 3=meridional.
Set SYSTEM=Z RECTANGULAR to deﬁne a rectangular Cartesian system by the three points a,
b, and c shown in Figure 1. Point c is the origin of the system, point a must lie on the 
-axis, and
point b must lie on the 
-
 plane. Although not necessary, it is intuitive to select point b such
that it is on or near the local 
-axis.

Set OP=ADD to indicate that the output request being deﬁned should be added to the output requests
deﬁned in previous steps.
Set OP=REPLACE to indicate that this output request should replace an output request of the same
type (e.g., FIELD) and frequency deﬁned in a previous step. If there is no matching request, this
output request will be interpreted as OP=ADD.
TIME INTERVAL
Set this parameter equal to the time interval at which the output states are to be written.
For ﬁeld output Abaqus/Explicit will always write the output at the beginning of the step. If both
this parameter and the NUMBER INTERVAL parameter are omitted, ﬁeld output will be written
at 20 equally spaced intervals throughout the step. The NUMBER INTERVAL, TIME INTERVAL,
and TIME POINTS parameters are mutually exclusive for ﬁeld data.
For history output Abaqus/Explicit will always write the data values at the beginning and end of
the step. If both this parameter and the FREQUENCY parameter are omitted, history output will be
written at 200 equally spaced intervals throughout the step. The FREQUENCY and TIME
INTERVAL parameters are mutually exclusive for history data.
VARIABLE
Set VARIABLE=ALL to indicate that all variables applicable to this procedure and material type
should be written to the output database.
Set VARIABLE=PRESELECT to indicate that the default output variables for the current procedure
type should be written to the output database. Additional output requests can be deﬁned with the
output options used in conjunction with the *OUTPUT option, listed previously.
If this parameter is omitted, only the variables requested for output with the individual output options
will be written to the output database.

Required parameters:
PARAMETER
Set this keyword parameter equal to the name of the parameter to which the shape variation data
refer. If this parameter is also a design parameter, the shape variations are used to deﬁne the design
gradients of the nodal coordinates for design sensitivity analysis.

that the shape variation data will be entered directly on the data lines):
FILE
Set this parameter equal to the name of the results ﬁle from a previous Abaqus/Standard analysis

displacements from a *STATIC analysis. This option cannot be used for models deﬁned in terms of

See Input Syntax Rules for the syntax of such ﬁle names.
Required parameter if the FILE parameter is used:

*PARAMETER SHAPE VARIATION

Set this parameter equal to the node set to which the shape variation values are to be applied. If this
parameter is omitted, the shape variation will be applied to all nodes in the model.

SYSTEM=C to specify the shape variation as values of cylindrical coordinates. Set SYSTEM=S to
specify the shape variation as values of spherical coordinates. See Figure 1.
The SYSTEM parameter is entirely local to this option and should not be confused with the *SYSTEM
option. As the data lines are read, the shape variation values speciﬁed are transformed to the global
rectangular Cartesian coordinate system. This transformation requires that the object be centered
about the origin of the global coordinate system; i.e., the *SYSTEM option should be off when
specifying shape variations as values using either cylindrical or spherical coordinates. The details
of how the shape variation is computed in particular coordinate systems are given in Parametric
Shape Variation.

Required parameters:
TYPE
Set TYPE=2D to create a cavity composed of the cavity surface deﬁned in the model and a series
of similar images generated by its repetition according to a two-dimensional distance vector. The
repeated images are bounded by lines parallel to line 
 (see Figure 1). The distance vector must
be deﬁned so that it points away from line 
 and into the domain of the model. This option can be
used only for two-dimensional cases.
Set TYPE=3D to create a cavity composed of the cavity surface deﬁned in the model and a series
of similar images generated by its repetition according to a three-dimensional distance vector. The
repeated images are bounded by planes parallel to plane 
 (see Figure 2). The distance vector
must be deﬁned so that it points away from plane 
 and into the domain of the model. This option
can be used only for three-dimensional cases.
Set TYPE=ZDIR to create a cavity composed of the cavity surface deﬁned in the model and a series
of similar images generated by its repetition in the z-direction. The repeated images are bounded
by lines of constant z-coordinate (see Figure 3). The z-distance vector must be deﬁned so that it
points away from the z-constant periodic symmetry reference line and into the domain of the model.
This option can be used only for axisymmetric cases.
Optional parameters:

Set this parameter equal to the number of repetitions used in the numerical calculation of the cavity
view factors resulting from the periodic symmetry. The result of this symmetry is a cavity composed
of the cavity surface deﬁned in the model plus twice NR similar images, since the periodic symmetry
is assumed to apply both in the positive and negative directions of the distance vector. The default

Required parameters:
MAIN
Set this parameter equal to the name of the main surface of the contact pair used in the pressure
penetration analysis.
SECONDARY
Set this parameter equal to the name of the secondary surface of the contact pair used in the pressure
penetration analysis.
Optional parameters:
AMPLITUDE
Set this parameter equal to the name of the amplitude curve that deﬁnes the variation of the ﬂuid
pressure during the step. If this parameter is omitted, the reference magnitude is applied immediately
at the beginning of the step or ramped up linearly over the step, depending on the value assigned to
the AMPLITUDE parameter on the *STEP option (see Deﬁning an Analysis).
OP
Set OP=MOD (default) for existing pressure penetration loads to remain, with this option modifying
existing pressure penetration loads or deﬁning additional pressure penetration loads.
Set OP=NEW if all existing pressure penetration loads applied to the model should be removed.
New pressure penetration loads can be deﬁned.
PENETRATION TIME
Set this parameter equal to a time period over which the ﬂuid pressure on newly penetrated contact
surface segments is ramped up to the current magnitude. The default penetration time period is
chosen to be 0.001 of the current step time. This parameter will be neglected in a linear perturbation
analysis, in which case the current ﬂuid pressure will be applied immediately once the pressure
penetration criterion is satisﬁed.
WETTED FRONT
This parameter only applies to two dimensional elements.
Set WETTED FRONT=NODE (default) to indicate the ﬂuid pressure loading is applied only to the
wetted region until the front penetrated node.
1033
*PRESSURE PENETRATION

Set WETTED FRONT=MID ELEMENT to indicate that the ﬂuid pressure loading is ramped down
and also applied to the unwetted front element region beyond the front penetrated node.
Optional, mutually exclusive parameters for matrix generation and steady-state dynamics
analysis (direct or modal):
IMAGINARY
Include this parameter to deﬁne the imaginary (out-of-phase) part of the loading.
REAL
Include this parameter (default) to deﬁne the real (in-phase) part of the loading.
Data lines to define the pressure penetration loads:
First line:
1. A node or node set on the secondary surface that is exposed to the ﬂuid. If a node set label is
given, it can contain only one node for two dimensional models; while for three dimensional
models, it can contain any number of nodes.
2. A node or node set on the main surface that is exposed to the ﬂuid. If a node set label is given,
it can contain only one node for two dimensional models; while for three dimensional models,
it can contain any number of nodes. This ﬁeld should be left blank if the main surface is an
analytical rigid surface. This ﬁeld can be also left blank for a three-dimensional model even if
the main surface is not an analytical rigid surface.
3. Fluid pressure magnitude.
4. Enter the critical contact pressure below which ﬂuid penetration starts to occur. The higher this
value, the easier the ﬂuid penetrates. The default is zero, in which case ﬂuid penetration occurs
only if contact is lost.
Repeat this data line as often as necessary to define fluid penetrations from different locations on the
surface, possibly with different fluid pressure magnitudes. Alternatively, the *PRESSURE
PENETRATION option can be repeated (if, for example, a different amplitude reference is needed).

Optional parameters for using the data line format:
AMPLITUDE
Set this parameter equal to the name of the amplitude curve that gives the time variation of the
pressure throughout the step. If the AMPLITUDE parameter is omitted, the reference magnitude is
applied either immediately at the beginning of the step or linearly over the step, depending on the
value assigned to the AMPLITUDE parameter on the *STEP option (see Deﬁning an Analysis).
INPUT
Set this parameter equal to the name of the alternate input ﬁle containing the data lines for this
option. See Input Syntax Rules for the syntax of such ﬁle names. If this parameter is omitted, it is
assumed that the data follow the keyword line.
OP
Set OP=MOD (default) for existing *PRESSURE STRESS values to remain, with this option
modifying existing values or deﬁning additional values.
Set OP=NEW if all existing *PRESSURE STRESS values should be removed. New pressure stress
values can be deﬁned.
For a general analysis step, a pressure that is removed via OP=NEW is reset to the value given on
the *INITIAL CONDITIONS option or to zero if no initial pressure was deﬁned. For a linear
perturbation step, a pressure that is removed via OP=NEW is always reset to zero. If pressures are
being returned to their initial condition values, the AMPLITUDE parameter described above does
not apply. Rather, the AMPLITUDE parameter given on the *STEP option governs the behavior.
If pressures are being reset to new values (not to initial conditions) via OP=NEW, the AMPLITUDE
parameter described above applies.
Required parameter for reading equivalent pressure stresses from the results file:

Set this parameter equal to the name of the results ﬁle (including the optional .fil extension) from
which the data are read. See Input Syntax Rules for the syntax of such ﬁle names.

Optional parameters for reading equivalent pressure stresses from the results file:
BSTEP
Set this parameter equal to the step number (of the analysis whose results ﬁle is being used as input

begin reading pressure data from the ﬁrst step available on the results ﬁle.
BINC
Set this parameter equal to the increment number (of the analysis whose results ﬁle is being used
as input to this option) that begins the history data to be read. If no value is supplied, Abaqus/Standard
will begin reading pressure data from the ﬁrst increment available (excluding any zero increments)
for step BSTEP on the results ﬁle.
ESTEP
Set this parameter equal to the step number (of the analysis whose results ﬁle is being used as input
to this option) that ends the history data to be read. If no value is supplied, ESTEP is taken as equal
to BSTEP.
EINC
Set this parameter equal to the increment number (of the analysis whose results ﬁle is being used
as input to this option) that ends the history data to be read. If no value is supplied, EINC is taken
as the last available increment of step ESTEP on the results ﬁle.
Required parameter for defining data in user subroutine UPRESS:
USER
Include this parameter to indicate that user subroutine UPRESS will be used to deﬁne equivalent
pressure stress values. UPRESS will be called for each node given on the data lines. If values are
also given on the data lines, these values will be ignored. If a results ﬁle has been speciﬁed in
addition to user subroutine UPRESS, values read from the results ﬁle will be passed into UPRESS
for possible modiﬁcation.
Data lines to define pressures using the data line format:
First line:
1. Node set or node number. If a node set label is given, all nodes in this set must have identical
initial pressures.
2. Reference pressure value (positive in compression). If the AMPLITUDE parameter is present,
this value will be modiﬁed by the AMPLITUDE speciﬁcation.
Repeat this line as often as necessary to define the pressure at different nodes or node sets.
To read pressures from an Abaqus/Standard results file (FILE):
No data lines are used when pressure data are read from a results ﬁle.
Data lines to define equivalent pressure stresses using user subroutine UPRESS:

*RADIATE: Specify radiation conditions in heat transfer analyses.
This option is used to apply radiation boundary conditions between a nonconcave surface and a nonreﬂecting
environment in fully coupled thermal-stress analysis. In Abaqus/Standard it is also used for all procedures that
solve for nodal temperature degrees of freedom.
It must be used in conjunction with the *PHYSICAL CONSTANTS option, which is used to deﬁne the
Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

Optional parameters:
AMBIENT AMPLITUDE
Set this parameter equal to the name of the *AMPLITUDE option that gives the variation of the
ambient temperature with time.
If this parameter is omitted in an Abaqus/Standard analysis, the reference magnitude is applied
immediately at the beginning of the step or linearly over the step, depending on the value assigned
to the AMPLITUDE parameter on the *STEP option (see Deﬁning an Analysis). If this parameter
is omitted in an Abaqus/Explicit analysis, the reference magnitude given on the data lines is applied
throughout the step.
OP
Set OP=MOD (default) for existing *RADIATE deﬁnitions to remain, with this option modifying
existing radiation conditions or deﬁning additional radiation conditions.
Set OP=NEW if all existing *RADIATE deﬁnitions applied to the model should be removed.
RADIATION AMPLITUDE
Set this parameter equal to the name of the *AMPLITUDE option that gives the variation of the
total radiation ﬂux with time.
If this parameter is omitted in an Abaqus/Standard analysis, the total radiation ﬂux, accounting for
any AMBIENT AMPLITUDE, is applied immediately, independent of the value assigned to the
AMPLITUDE parameter on the *STEP option. If this parameter is omitted in an Abaqus/Explicit
analysis, the total radiation ﬂux, accounting for any AMBIENT AMPLITUDE, is applied immediately
at the beginning of the step.
REGION TYPE
This parameter applies only to Abaqus/Explicit analyses.
This parameter is relevant only for radiation conditions applied to the boundary of an adaptive mesh
domain. If a radiation condition is applied to a surface in the interior of an adaptive mesh domain,
the nodes on the surface will move with the material in all directions (they will be nonadaptive).
Abaqus/Explicit will create a boundary region automatically on the surface subjected to the deﬁned
radiation condition.
Abaqus Keywords Guide
1050
*RADIATE

Set REGION TYPE=LAGRANGIAN (default) to apply the radiation condition to a Lagrangian
boundary region. The edge of a Lagrangian boundary region will follow the material while allowing
adaptive meshing along the edge and within the interior of the region.
Set REGION TYPE=SLIDING to apply the radiation condition to a sliding boundary region. The
edge of a sliding boundary region will slide over the material. Adaptive meshing will occur along
the edge and in the interior of the region. Mesh constraints are typically applied on the edge of a
sliding boundary region to ﬁx it spatially.
Set REGION TYPE=EULERIAN to apply the radiation condition to an Eulerian boundary region.
This option is used to create a boundary region across which material can ﬂow. Mesh constraints
must be used normal to an Eulerian boundary region to allow material to ﬂow through the region.
If no mesh constraints are applied, an Eulerian boundary region will behave in the same way as a
sliding boundary region.

*REBAR

*REBAR LAYER: Define layers of reinforcement in membrane, shell, surface,
and continuum elements.
This option is used to deﬁne one or multiple rebar layers in membrane, shell, and surface elements. It must be
used in conjunction with the *MEMBRANE SECTION, the *SHELL SECTION, or the *SURFACE SECTION
option. Rebar layers in solid (continuum) elements can be deﬁned by embedding a set of surface or membrane
elements with rebar layers in a set of host continuum elements through the use of the *EMBEDDED ELEMENT
option.
Products: Abaqus/Standard Abaqus/Explicit Abaqus/CAE
Type:  Model data
Level: Part,  Part instance
Abaqus/CAE: Property module; supported only for membrane and shell elements.
References:
• Deﬁning Reinforcement
• Embedded Elements
• *EMBEDDED ELEMENT
• *MEMBRANE SECTION
• *SHELL SECTION
• *SURFACE SECTION
Optional parameters:
GEOMETRY
Use this parameter to specify the type of rebar geometry.
Set GEOMETRY=CONSTANT (default) if the rebar spacing in the element is constant. The spacing
is given as a length measure on the data lines.
Set GEOMETRY=ANGULAR if the rebar spacing increases linearly as a function of the distance
measured from the axis of revolution in a cylindrical coordinate system. The spacing is given as an
angular spacing in degrees on the data lines. A cylindrical orientation system must be deﬁned if this
option is used with three-dimensional membrane, shell, or surface elements.
Set GEOMETRY=LIFT EQUATION if the rebar spacing and orientation within the element is
determined by the tire “lift” equation. The rebar parameters are deﬁned with respect to the uncured
or “green” tire conﬁguration, and the lift equation maps the rebar parameters to the cured tire
conﬁguration. The spacing is given as a length measure on the data lines. A cylindrical orientation
system must be deﬁned if this option is used with three-dimensional membrane, shell, or surface
elements.
ORIENTATION
This parameter is meaningful only for rebar in general shell, membrane, and surface elements. Set
this parameter equal to the name of an orientation deﬁnition that deﬁnes the angular orientation of
the rebar on the data lines. If this parameter is omitted, the angular orientation of rebar on the data
lines is speciﬁed relative to the default projected local surface directions. This parameter is not
permitted with axisymmetric shell, axisymmetric membrane, and axisymmetric surface elements.

*REBAR LAYER

Data lines to define rebar layers:
First line:
1. A name that will be used to identify this rebar layer. This name can be used in deﬁning rebar
prestress and output requests. Each layer of rebar must be given a separate name in a particular
element or element set.
2. Cross-sectional area of the rebar.
3. Spacing of rebar in the plane of the membrane, shell, or surface element. The value is given as
a length measure unless the GEOMETRY=ANGULAR parameter is speciﬁed, in which case
the value should be given in terms of angular spacing in degrees. Specify the spacing in the
uncured geometry if GEOMETRY=LIFT EQUATION.
4. Position of the rebar in the shell section thickness direction. This value is given as the distance
of the rebar from the middle surface of the shell, positive in the direction of the positive normal
to the shell. This value is modiﬁed if the NODAL THICKNESS parameter is included with the
*SHELL SECTION option for the underlying shell element. This entry has no meaning for rebar
in either membrane or surface elements.
5. Name of the material forming this rebar layer.
6. For three-dimensional shell, membrane, and surface elements, specify the angular orientation
of rebar (in degrees) between the positive local 1-direction and the rebar. Specify the angle in
the uncured geometry if GEOMETRY=LIFT EQUATION.
The local 1-direction can be deﬁned by using the *ORIENTATION option and setting the
ORIENTATION parameter equal to the orientation name. If the ORIENTATION parameter is
omitted, the local 1-direction is deﬁned by the default projected local surface directions. The
optional ORIENTATION parameter given on the *MEMBRANE SECTION and the *SHELL
SECTION options has no inﬂuence on the rebar angular orientation.
For axisymmetric shell, axisymmetric membrane, and axisymmetric surface elements, specify
the angular orientation of rebar from the meridional plane in degrees (0° is meridional, 90° is
circumferential). Positive rotation is about the positive normal to the shell, membrane, or surface
elements.
7. The isoparametric direction from which the rebar angle output will be measured. The default is
1.
8. Extension ratio, e, for rebar deﬁned with GEOMETRY=LIFT EQUATION. In a tire e represents
the pre-strain that occurs during the curing process; e =1 means a 100% extension. This entry
has no meaning for rebar deﬁned using GEOMETRY=CONSTANT or
GEOMETRY=ANGULAR.
9. Radius, 
, of the rebar deﬁned with GEOMETRY=LIFT EQUATION. The value is the position
of the rebar in the uncured geometry, measured with respect to the axis of rotation in a cylindrical
coordinate system. This entry has no meaning for rebar deﬁned using GEOMETRY=CONSTANT
or GEOMETRY=ANGULAR.
Repeat the data line as often as necessary. Each data line defines a layer of rebar.

Optional parameters:
COMP
Set COMP=ALGEBRAIC to sum the directional excitation components algebraically. If this
parameter is used, the directional excitation components are summed ﬁrst, followed by the modal
summation.
Set COMP=SRSS (default) to use the square root of the sum of the squares. If this parameter is

Set COMP=R40 to use the 40% rule as recommended by the ASCE 4–98 Guide that assumes that
for the maximum response from one component, the responses from the other two components are
40% of their maximum value.
Set COMP=R30 to use the 30% rule. This rule assumes that for the maximum response from one

*RESTART: Save and reuse data and analysis results.
Warning: This option can create a very large amount of data.
This option is used to control the writing and reading of restart data.

• Restarting an Analysis
Controlling the writing and reading of restart data in an Abaqus/Standard
analysis
At least one of the following parameters is required:
READ
Include this parameter to specify that this analysis is a restart of a previous analysis. The basic model
deﬁnition data (elements, materials, nodes) cannot be changed at such a restart. However, element
sets, node sets, and *AMPLITUDE tables can be added, and history data subsequent to that part of
the history already analyzed can be changed.
WRITE
Include this parameter to specify that restart data are to be written during the analysis.
Optional parameters if the READ parameter is used:
CYCLE
If the new analysis is restarted from a previous low-cycle fatigue analysis, set this parameter equal
to the cycle number within the speciﬁed step of the low-cycle fatigue analysis after which the analysis
will resume. Since the new analysis can be restarted only from the end of a loading cycle in the
previous low-cycle fatigue analysis, the INC parameter is irrelevant and is ignored if the CYCLE
parameter is speciﬁed.
If this parameter is omitted, the restart will begin at the end of the last cycle for the speciﬁed step.
END STEP
This parameter speciﬁes that the user wishes to terminate the current step in the analysis from which
the restart is being made.
This parameter is useful when the user wishes to redeﬁne the loading history, output options, or
tolerance controls, etc. If this parameter is included, the data must contain further step deﬁnitions
to deﬁne how the analysis will continue.
Abaqus Keywords Guide
1082
*RESTART

If this parameter is omitted, Abaqus/Standard will continue the analysis to complete the current step
as it is deﬁned in the run from which the restart is being made.
INC
Set this parameter equal to the increment number within the step speciﬁed by the STEP parameter,
after which the analysis will resume.
If this parameter is omitted, the restart will begin at the end of the step speciﬁed on the STEP
parameter.
ITERATION
If the new analysis is restarted from a previous direct cyclic analysis, set this parameter equal to the
iteration number within the speciﬁed step of the direct cyclic analysis after which the analysis will
resume. Since the new analysis can be restarted only from the end of a loading cycle in the previous
direct cyclic analysis, the INC parameter is irrelevant and is ignored if the ITERATION parameter
is speciﬁed.
If this parameter is omitted, the restart will begin at the end of the last iteration for the speciﬁed
step.
STEP
Set this parameter equal to the step number at which the restart will be made.
If this parameter is omitted, the analysis will restart at the last available step found.
Optional parameters if the WRITE parameter is used:
FREQUENCY
This parameter speciﬁes the increments at which restart information will be written. For example,
FREQUENCY=2 will write restart information at increments 2, 4, 6, etc.
For a direct cyclic analysis this parameter speciﬁes the iteration numbers at which restart information
will be written; restart information will be written only at the end of an iteration.
For a low-cycle fatigue analysis this parameter speciﬁes the cycle numbers at which restart
information will be written; restart information will be written only at the end of a cycle.
When restart is requested in an analysis, restart information is always written at the end of a step.
Set FREQUENCY=0 to discontinue the writing of restart data.
The FREQUENCY and NUMBER INTERVAL parameters are mutually exclusive. The default is
FREQUENCY=1.
NUMBER INTERVAL
Set this parameter equal to the number of intervals during the step at which the *RESTART data are
to be written. The value of this parameter must be a positive integer.
Specifying the NUMBER INTERVAL parameter is the recommended method of synchronizing
restart information when performing a co-simulation. In this case Abaqus/Standard will write restart
information at the co-simulation target time immediately after the time dictated by the NUMBER
INTERVAL parameter.
The FREQUENCY and NUMBER INTERVAL parameters are mutually exclusive. The default is
FREQUENCY=1.
TIME MARKS
Set TIME MARKS=YES (default) to write results at the exact times dictated by the NUMBER
INTERVAL parameter.
1083
Abaqus Keywords Guide
*RESTART

Set TIME MARKS=NO to write the restart at the increment ending immediately after the time
dictated by the NUMBER INTERVAL parameter.
When used with the NUMBER INTERVAL parameter in a co-simulation, the TIME MARKS
parameter is always set to NO to write restart information at the co-simulation target time after the
time dictated by the NUMBER INTERVAL parameter.
OVERLAY
This parameter speciﬁes that only one increment should be retained per step, thus minimizing the
storage space needed.
When the OVERLAY parameter is included, each increment written overlays the previous increment,
if any, written for the same step. If this parameter is omitted, data are retained for every increment.
In either case the last increment of every step is retained.
There are no data lines associated with this option.
Controlling the writing and reading of restart data in an Abaqus/Explicit
analysis
At least one of the following parameters is required:
READ
Include this parameter to specify that this analysis is a restart of a previous analysis. The basic model
deﬁnition data (elements, materials, nodes) cannot be changed at such a restart. However, element
sets, node sets, and *AMPLITUDE tables can be added, and history data subsequent to that part of
the history already analyzed can be changed.
WRITE
Include this parameter to specify that restart data are to be written during the analysis.
Required parameter if the READ parameter is used:
STEP
Set this parameter equal to the step number at which the restart will be made. If the END STEP and
INTERVAL parameters are omitted, the analysis will resume after the last interval available in this
step.
Optional parameters if the READ parameter is used:
END STEP
Include this parameter to specify that the current step should be terminated at this point. The
INTERVAL parameter is required when this parameter is used.
This parameter is useful when the user wishes to redeﬁne the loading history, contact surface
deﬁnitions, etc.
If this parameter is omitted, Abaqus/Explicit will continue the analysis from the last available restart
interval to complete the current step as it is deﬁned in the run from which the restart is being made.

Abaqus Keywords Guide
1084
*RESTART

Set this parameter equal to the interval number within the step speciﬁed by the STEP parameter
after which the analysis will resume. The END STEP parameter is required when this parameter is
used.
Optional parameters if the WRITE parameter is used:
NUMBER INTERVAL
Set this parameter equal to the number of intervals during the step at which the *RESTART data are
to be written. The value of this parameter must be a positive integer or zero. A value of zero turns
off all restart frame output, which can reduce disk usage if there is no continuation after the current
analysis. The default is NUMBER INTERVAL=1.
Abaqus/Explicit will divide the step into the speciﬁed number of time intervals, n, and write the
results at the beginning of the step and at the end of each interval, for a total of n+1 points for the
step, with the last point matching the end of the step. For example, if NUMBER INTERVAL=10,
Abaqus/Explicit will write 11 restart states, consisting of the values at the beginning of the step and
the values at 10 evenly spaced intervals throughout the step.
For a co-simulation Abaqus/Explicit will write restart information at the co-simulation target time
immediately after the time dictated by the NUMBER INTERVAL parameter.
TIME MARKS
Set TIME MARKS=NO (default) to write the restart at the increment ending immediately after the
time dictated by the NUMBER INTERVAL parameter.
Set TIME MARKS=YES to write results at the exact times dictated by the NUMBER INTERVAL
parameter. TIME MARKS=YES cannot be used when either the FIXED TIME INCREMENTATION
or DIRECT USER CONTROL parameter is included on the *DYNAMIC option (Explicit Dynamic
Analysis).
For a co-simulation the TIME MARKS parameter is always set to NO to write restart information
at the co-simulation target time after the time dictated by the NUMBER INTERVAL parameter.
OVERLAY
This parameter speciﬁes that only one increment should be retained per step, thus minimizing the
storage space needed.
When the OVERLAY parameter is included, each increment written overlays the previous increment,
if any, written for the same step. If this parameter is omitted, data are retained for every increment.
In either case the last increment of every step is retained.
SINGLE
This parameter speciﬁes that only single precision restart data are to be written when the double
precision executable is run.
When the single precision executable is run, this parameter is ignored and only single precision
restart data will be written. If this parameter is omitted, double precision restart data will be written
when the double precision executable is run.
There are no data lines associated with this option.

Required parameters:
REF NODE
Set this parameter equal to either the node number of the rigid body reference node or the name of
a node set containing the rigid body reference node. If the name of a node set is chosen, the node
set must contain exactly one node.
At least one of the following parameters is required:
ANALYTICAL SURFACE
Set this parameter equal to the name of the analytical surface to be assigned to the rigid body.
ELSET
Set this parameter equal to the name of the element set containing the elements to be assigned to
the rigid body. An element cannot appear in more than one rigid body.
PIN NSET
Set this parameter equal to the name of a node set containing pin-type nodes to be assigned to the
rigid body. This parameter can be used to add nodes to a rigid body or to redeﬁne node types of
nodes on elements included in the rigid body by the ELSET parameter. Pin-type nodes have only
their translational degrees of freedom associated with the rigid body. A node cannot appear in more
than one rigid body deﬁnition.
TIE NSET
Set this parameter equal to the name of a node set containing tie-type nodes to be assigned to the
rigid body. This parameter can be used to add nodes to a rigid body or to redeﬁne node types of
nodes on elements included in the rigid body by the ELSET parameter. Tie-type nodes have both
their translational and rotational degrees of freedom associated with the rigid body. A node cannot
appear in more than one rigid body deﬁnition.

*RIGID BODY

Optional parameters:
ALPHA
This parameter applies only to Abaqus/Standard analyses.
Set this parameter equal to the thermal expansion coefﬁcient.
ISOTHERMAL
This parameter is used only for fully coupled thermal-stress analysis.
Set this parameter equal to YES to specify an isothermal rigid body. The default is
ISOTHERMAL=NO.
POSITION
Set POSITION=INPUT (default) if the location of the reference node is to be deﬁned by the user.
Set POSITION=CENTER OF MASS if the reference node is to be located at the center of mass of
the rigid body.
Optional parameters (use only when the element set specified contains rigid elements):
DENSITY
This parameter applies only to Abaqus/Explicit analyses.
Set this parameter equal to the density of all of the rigid elements in the element set.
NODAL THICKNESS
This parameter applies only to Abaqus/Explicit analyses.
Include this parameter to indicate that the thickness of the rigid elements should not be read from
the data line but should be interpolated from the thickness speciﬁed at the nodes with the *NODAL
THICKNESS option.
OFFSET
This parameter applies only to Abaqus/Explicit analyses.
Include this parameter to deﬁne the distance (as a fraction of the rigid element's thickness) from the
element's midsurface to the reference surface containing the element's nodes. Since no element level
calculations are performed for rigid elements, a speciﬁed offset affects only the handling of contact
pairs with rigid surfaces formed by rigid elements.
This parameter accepts positive or negative values or the labels SPOS or SNEG. The positive values
of the offset are in the direction of the element normal. When OFFSET=0.5 (or SPOS), the top
surface of the rigid element is the reference surface. When OFFSET=−0.5 (or SNEG), the bottom
surface of the rigid element is the reference surface. The default is OFFSET=0, which indicates that
the middle surface of the rigid element is the reference surface.

by the scale factors for material mass.
This option is used to specify scale factors using a distribution for material mass. In addition, in an adjoint design
sensitivity analysis, you can specify quantities that represent the derivatives of the scale factors divided by the

Warning:  Using values larger than the default values for hourglass control can produce excessively stiff
response and sometimes can even lead to instability if the values are too large. Hourglassing that occurs
with the default hourglass control parameters is usually an indication that the mesh is too coarse. Therefore,
it is generally better to reﬁne the mesh than to add stronger hourglass control.
This option is used to
•
choose a nondefault hourglass control approach for reduced-integration elements in Abaqus/Standard and
Abaqus/Explicit and modiﬁed tetrahedral or triangular elements in Abaqus/Standard,
•
scale the default coefﬁcients used in the hourglass control,
•
activate distortion control for solid elements, and
•
control the activation of bending stabilization for full-integration linear elements modeled with hyperelastic
materials and specify the scale factor.
In Abaqus/Explicit this option is also used to
•
select a nondefault kinematic formulation for 8-node brick elements,
•
choose the second-order accurate formulation for solids and shells,
•
scale the drill stiffness of shell elements,
•
turn off the drill stiffness in small-strain shell elements S3RS and S4RS,
•
introduce the stresses in membrane elements from the initial conﬁguration gradually into the model,
•
scale the linear and quadratic bulk viscosities,
•
specify the size of the particle tracking box for discrete element method (DEM) analyses and smoothed
particle hydrodynamic (SPH) analyses,
•
specify additional control parameters for SPH analyses,
•
specify whether elements must be deleted when they are completely damaged,
•
specify a value of the scalar degradation parameter at or above which elements are assumed to be completely
damaged,
•
control the activation of the "improved" element time estimation method for three-dimensional continuum
elements and elements with plane stress formulations,
•
control shell element deletion based on integration point status, and
•
control distortion-based element deletion.
This option is used in conjunction with the *MEMBRANE SECTION, *SHELL GENERAL SECTION, *SHELL
SECTION, and *SOLID SECTION options. It can be used with *BEAM SECTION and *BEAM GENERAL
SECTION to scale the linear and bulk viscosities. It can also be used with the *SOLID SECTION, *SHELL

Required parameters:
ELSET
Set this parameter equal to the name of the element set containing the shell elements for which the
section behavior is being deﬁned.
Required parameter in Abaqus/Explicit, optional parameter in Abaqus/Standard:
DENSITY
Set this parameter equal to the mass per unit surface area of the shell.
If the MATERIAL and COMPOSITE parameters are omitted, this density accounts for the mass of
the shell, since no material deﬁnition is given.
If the MATERIAL or COMPOSITE parameter is used, the mass of the shell includes a contribution
from this parameter in addition to any contribution from the material deﬁnition.
Optional parameters:
BENDING ONLY
Include this parameter to ignore membrane stiffness effects in the shell. Bending stiffness and
transverse shear stiffness coefﬁcients are computed normally. Membrane-bending coupling
coefﬁcients are set to zero. Diagonal membrane stiffness coefﬁcients are set to 1 × 10−6 times the
largest diagonal bending stiffness term. Off-diagonal membrane stiffness coefﬁcients are set to zero.
CONTROLS
In an Abaqus/Explicit analysis, set this parameter equal to the name of a section controls deﬁnition
(see Section Controls) to be used to specify the second-order accurate element formulation option,
a nondefault hourglass control formulation option, or scale factors.
In an Abaqus/Standard analysis, set this parameter equal to the name of a section controls deﬁnition
to be used to specify the enhanced hourglass control formulation (see Section Controls) or to be
used in a subsequent Abaqus/Explicit import analysis.
LAYUP
This parameter is relevant only when the COMPOSITE parameter is used.
1137
*SHELL GENERAL SECTION

Set this parameter equal to the name of a composite layup (see Composite layups). Abaqus/CAE
uses this name to identify the composite layup that contains the shell section.
MEMBRANE ONLY
Include this parameter to ignore bending stiffness effects in the shell. Membrane stiffness and
transverse shear stiffness coefﬁcients are computed normally. Membrane-bending coupling
coefﬁcients are set to zero. Diagonal bending stiffness coefﬁcients are set to 1 × 10−6 times the
largest diagonal membrane stiffness term. Off-diagonal bending stiffness coefﬁcients are set to zero.
OFFSET
Include this parameter to deﬁne the distance (as a fraction of the shell thickness) from the shell
midsurface to the reference surface (containing the nodes of the element). This parameter accepts
positive or negative values, the labels SPOS or SNEG, or in an Abaqus/Standard analysis the name
of a distribution (see Distribution Deﬁnition).
Positive values of the offset are in the positive normal direction (see About Shell Elements). When
OFFSET=0.5 (or SPOS), the top surface of the shell is the reference surface. When OFFSET=−0.5
(or SNEG), the bottom surface of the shell is the reference surface. The default is OFFSET=0, which
indicates that the middle surface of the shell is the reference surface.
In an Abaqus/Standard analysis a spatially varying offset can be speciﬁed by setting OFFSET equal
to the name of a distribution. The distribution used to deﬁne the shell offset must have a default
value. The default offset is used by any shell element assigned to the shell section that is not
speciﬁcally assigned a value in the distribution.
ORIENTATION
Set this parameter equal to the name of an orientation deﬁnition (see Orientations) to be used with
the section forces and section strains.
POISSON
Include this parameter to deﬁne the shell thickness direction behavior.
Set this parameter equal to a nonzero value to cause the thickness direction strain under plane stress
conditions to be a linear function of the membrane strains. The value of the POISSON parameter
must be between −1.0 and 0.5.
Set POISSON=ELASTIC to automatically select this parameter value based on the initial isotropic
elastic part of the material deﬁnition.
The default is POISSON=0.5.
SMEAR ALL LAYERS
This parameter is relevant only when the COMPOSITE parameter is used.
Include this parameter to ignore the material layer stacking sequence. Transverse shear stiffness
coefﬁcients are computed normally. Membrane-bending coupling terms are set to zero, and bending
stiffness terms are computed as T2/12 times the corresponding membrane stiffness terms, where T
is the total thickness of the shell.
STACK DIRECTION
This parameter is relevant only for continuum shells.
Set this parameter equal to 1, 2, 3, or ORIENTATION to deﬁne the continuum shell stack or thickness
direction. Specify one of the numerical values to select the corresponding isoparametric direction
of the element as the stack or thickness direction. The default is STACK DIRECTION=3.
If STACK DIRECTION=ORIENTATION, the ORIENTATION parameter is also required.
Abaqus Keywords Guide
1138
*SHELL GENERAL SECTION

To obtain a desired thickness direction, the appropriate numerical value for the STACK DIRECTION
parameter depends on the element connectivity. For a mesh-independent speciﬁcation, use STACK
DIRECTION=ORIENTATION. If the orientation assigned to the ORIENTATION parameter is
deﬁned with a distribution (Distribution Deﬁnition), STACK DIRECTION=ORIENTATION is not
supported.
SYMMETRIC
This parameter is relevant only when the COMPOSITE parameter is used.
Include this parameter if the layers in the composite shell are symmetric about a central core. This
parameter cannot be used if a spatially varying thickness or orientation angle is deﬁned on any
composite layer using a distribution (Distribution Deﬁnition).
THICKNESS MODULUS
This parameter is relevant only for continuum shells.
Set this parameter equal to the effective thickness modulus.
Set THICKNESS MODULUS=ELASTIC to compute the effective thickness modulus based on the
in-plane elastic properties. In this case, the effective thickness modulus is set to the initial tensile
modulus in the out-of-plane direction. If you use this option, you must deﬁne the shell thickness
direction behavior using POISSON=ELASTIC.
ZERO
If the section is deﬁned by its general stiffness, set this parameter equal to 
, the reference
temperature for thermal expansion (for example, ZERO=50 means 
).
This parameter is ignored if the COMPOSITE, the MATERIAL, or the USER parameter is speciﬁed.
The following parameters are optional, mutually exclusive, and used only if the section is not
defined by its general stiffness on the data lines:
COMPOSITE
Include this parameter to indicate that the shell is composed of layers with different linear elastic
material behavior.
MATERIAL
Set this parameter equal to the name of the single linear elastic material of which the shell is made.
USER
This parameter cannot be used with continuum shell elements. See Using a General Shell Section
to Deﬁne the Section Behavior for use of this option in linear perturbation analyses.
Include this parameter to indicate that the shell section stiffness is deﬁned in user subroutine UGENS
(Abaqus/Standard) or user subroutine VUGENS (Abaqus/Explicit).
The following parameters are optional, mutually exclusive, and can be used only in combination
with the MATERIAL, the COMPOSITE, or the USER parameter:
NODAL THICKNESS
Include this parameter to indicate that the shell thickness should not be read from the data lines but
should be interpolated from the thickness speciﬁed at the nodes with the *NODAL THICKNESS
option. For composite sections the total thickness is interpolated from the nodes, and the thicknesses
of the layers speciﬁed on the data lines are scaled proportionally. This parameter is ignored for
continuum shells.
SHELL THICKNESS
1139
Abaqus Keywords Guide
*SHELL GENERAL SECTION

Set this parameter equal to the name of a distribution (Distribution Deﬁnition) to deﬁne spatially
varying thickness. If this parameter is used for a noncomposite section, the thickness on the data
line is ignored. For composite sections the total thickness is deﬁned by the distribution, and the
thicknesses of the layers speciﬁed on the data lines are scaled proportionally. This parameter is
ignored for continuum shells.
The distribution used to deﬁne shell thickness must have a default value. The default thickness is
used by any shell element assigned to the shell section that is not speciﬁcally assigned a value in
the distribution.
The following optional parameters can be used only in combination with the USER parameter:
DELETE
This parameter applies only to Abaqus/Explicit analyses.
Set this parameter equal to the number of the solution-dependent variable (of those deﬁned with the
VARIABLES parameter) that controls the deletion of the element.
I PROPERTIES
Set this parameter equal to the number of integer property values needed as data in user subroutine
UGENS or VUGENS. The default is I PROPERTIES=0.

subroutine UGENS or VUGENS. The default is PROPERTIES=0.
TVS DAMAGE
This parameter applies only to Abaqus/Explicit analyses.
Set this parameter equal to the number of the solution-dependent variable (of those deﬁned with the
VARIABLES parameter) that controls the transverse shear damage variable of the element.
UNSYMM
Include this parameter if the section stiffness matrices are not symmetric. This parameter will invoke
the unsymmetric equation solution capability.
VARIABLES
Set this parameter equal to the number of solution-dependent variables that must be stored for the
section. The default is VARIABLES=1.
Optional parameter for use when the MATERIAL, the COMPOSITE, and the USER parameters
are omitted:
DEPENDENCIES
Set this parameter equal to the number of ﬁeld variable dependencies included in the deﬁnition of
the scaling moduli, in addition to temperature. If this parameter is omitted, it is assumed that the

Required, mutually exclusive parameters:
COMPOSITE
Include this parameter if the shell is made up of several layers of material.
MATERIAL
Set this parameter equal to the name of the material of which the shell is made.

(see Section Controls) to be used to specify the second-order accurate element formulation option,
a nondefault hourglass control formulation option, or scale factors.
In an Abaqus/Standard analysis, set this parameter equal to the name of a section controls deﬁnition
to be used to specify the enhanced hourglass control formulation (see Section Controls) or to be

DENSITY
Set this parameter equal to a mass per unit surface area of the shell.
If this parameter is used, the mass of the shell includes a contribution from this parameter in addition
to any contribution from the material deﬁnition.
LAYUP
This parameter is relevant only when the COMPOSITE parameter is used.
Set this parameter equal to the name of a composite layup. This name identiﬁes the composite layup

NODAL THICKNESS
1143
*SHELL SECTION

Include this parameter to indicate that the shell thickness should not be read from the data lines but
should be interpolated from the thickness speciﬁed at the nodes with the *NODAL THICKNESS
option. For composite sections the total thickness is interpolated from the nodes and the thicknesses
of the layers speciﬁed on the data lines are scaled proportionally. This parameter is ignored for
continuum shells.
The NODAL THICKNESS and SHELL THICKNESS parameters are mutually exclusive.
OFFSET
Include this parameter to deﬁne the distance (as a fraction of the shell thickness) from the shell
midsurface to the reference surface (containing the nodes of the element). This parameter accepts
positive or negative values, the labels SPOS or SNEG, or the name of a distribution. See Distribution
Deﬁnition.
Positive values of the offset are in the positive normal direction (see About Shell Elements). When
OFFSET=0.5 (or SPOS), the top surface of the shell is the reference surface. When OFFSET=−0.5
(or SNEG), the bottom surface of the shell is the reference surface. The default is OFFSET=0, which
indicates that the middle surface of the shell is the reference surface.
In both Abaqus/Standard and Abaqus/Explicit analyses a spatially varying offset can be speciﬁed
by setting OFFSET equal to the name of a distribution. The distribution used to deﬁne the shell
offset must have a default value. The default offset is used by any shell element assigned to the shell
section that is not speciﬁcally assigned a value in the distribution.
ORIENTATION
Set this parameter equal to the name of an orientation deﬁnition (Orientations) to be used with
material calculations in this deﬁnition of shell section behavior. This orientation will be used for
material calculations and stress output in the individual layers, for the section forces output, and for
the transverse shear stiffness.
It is possible to use a different orientation deﬁnition for material calculations in the individual layers
of a composite shell by referencing an orientation deﬁnition or giving an orientation angle (in
degrees, positive counterclockwise relative to the shell local directions) on each layer deﬁnition
data line. Any layer deﬁnition line that does not have an orientation reference or an angle speciﬁed
will use the orientation deﬁned here. While an orientation deﬁned with a distribution can be used
to specify the overall orientation for the shell section, an orientation deﬁned with a distribution
cannot be speciﬁed on the layers of a composite shell.
POISSON
Include this parameter to deﬁne the shell thickness direction behavior.
Set this parameter equal to a nonzero value to cause the thickness direction strain under plane stress
conditions to be a linear function of the membrane strains. The value of the POISSON parameter
must be between −1.0 and 0.5.
Set POISSON=ELASTIC to automatically select this parameter value based on the initial elastic
part of the material deﬁnition.
Set POISSON=MATERIAL in an Abaqus/Explicit analysis to cause the thickness direction strain
under plane stress conditions to be a function of the membrane strains and the in-plane material
properties.
In Abaqus/Standard the default is POISSON=0.5; in Abaqus/Explicit the default is
POISSON=MATERIAL.
SECTION INTEGRATION
Set SECTION INTEGRATION=SIMPSON (default) to use Simpson's rule for the shell section
integration.
Abaqus Keywords Guide
1144
*SHELL SECTION

Set SECTION INTEGRATION=GAUSS to use Gauss quadrature for the shell section integration.
Gauss quadrature cannot be used for heat transfer or thermally coupled shell elements.
SHELL THICKNESS
Set this parameter equal to the name of a distribution (Distribution Deﬁnition) to deﬁne spatially
varying thickness. If this parameter is used for a noncomposite section the thickness on the data line
is ignored. For composite sections the total thickness is deﬁned by the distribution and the thicknesses
of the layers speciﬁed on the data lines are scaled proportionally. This parameter is ignored for
continuum shells.
The distribution used to deﬁne shell thickness must have a default value. The default thickness is
used by any shell element assigned to the shell section that is not speciﬁcally assigned a value in
the distribution.
The NODAL THICKNESS and SHELL THICKNESS parameters are mutually exclusive.
STACK DIRECTION
This parameter is relevant only for continuum shells.
Set this parameter equal to 1, 2, 3, or ORIENTATION to deﬁne the continuum shell stack or thickness
direction. Specify one of the numerical values to select the corresponding isoparametric direction
of the element as the stack or thickness direction. The default is STACK DIRECTION=3.
If STACK DIRECTION=ORIENTATION, the ORIENTATION parameter is also required.
To obtain a desired thickness direction, the appropriate numerical value for the STACK DIRECTION
parameter depends on the element connectivity. For a mesh-independent speciﬁcation, use STACK
DIRECTION=ORIENTATION. If the orientation assigned to the ORIENTATION parameter is
deﬁned with a distribution (Distribution Deﬁnition), STACK DIRECTION=ORIENTATION is not
supported.
SYMMETRIC
This parameter is relevant only when the COMPOSITE parameter is used.
Include this parameter if the layers in the composite shell are symmetric about a central core. This
parameter cannot be used if a spatially varying thickness or orientation angle is deﬁned on any
composite layer using a distribution (Distribution Deﬁnition).
TEMPERATURE
Use this parameter to select the mode of temperature and ﬁeld variable input used on the *FIELD,
the *INITIAL CONDITIONS, or the *TEMPERATURE options.
Omit the TEMPERATURE parameter to deﬁne the predeﬁned ﬁeld by its magnitude on the reference
surface of the shell and its gradient through the thickness.
Set TEMPERATURE=n, where n ( 1) is the number of predeﬁned ﬁeld variable points in the shell
or in each layer if the COMPOSITE parameter is used, to deﬁne the predeﬁned ﬁeld at n equally
spaced points through each layer of the shell section.
In a heat transfer analysis step or a coupled temperature-displacement analysis step when the *FIELD
option is used to specify values of predeﬁned ﬁeld variables, the TEMPERATURE parameter is
required to specify the number of ﬁeld variable points in the shell. The number of temperature points
in the shell with temperature degrees of freedom is deﬁned by the number of integration points
speciﬁed on the data lines.
THICKNESS MODULUS
This parameter is relevant only for continuum shells.
Set this parameter equal to the effective thickness modulus.

Abaqus Keywords Guide
*SHELL SECTION

Set THICKNESS MODULUS=ELASTIC to compute the effective thickness modulus based on the
in-plane elastic properties. In this case, the effective thickness modulus is set to the initial tensile
modulus in the out-of-plane direction. If you use this option, you must deﬁne the shell thickness
direction behavior using POISSON=ELASTIC.
Data line to define a homogeneous shell (the MATERIAL parameter is included):
First (and only) line:
1. Shell thickness. This value is ignored if the NODAL THICKNESS or SHELL THICKNESS
parameters are included.
2. Number of integration points to be used through the shell section. The default is ﬁve points if
Simpson's rule is used and three points if Gauss quadrature is used. The number of integration
points must be an odd number for Simpson's rule and is equal to the number of temperature
degrees of freedom at a node of the element if this section is associated with heat transfer or
coupled temperature-displacement elements. The maximum number of points for Simpson's rule
is 99, and in the case of heat transfer or coupled temperature-displacement elements it is 19.
This number must be at least 2 and less than or equal to 15 for Gauss quadrature. For Simpson's
rule it must be at least 3, except in a pure heat transfer analysis, where the number of integration
points can be 1 for a constant temperature through the shell thickness.

First line:
1. For conventional shell elements enter a positive scalar value deﬁning the actual layer thickness
or the name of a distribution (Distribution Deﬁnition) that deﬁnes spatially varying layer
thicknesses. The layer thickness is modiﬁed if the NODAL THICKNESS or SHELL THICKNESS
parameter is included.
For continuum shell elements enter a positive scalar value deﬁning the relative thickness of this
layer with respect to the other layers. The thickness ratios for the layers need not be given in
physical units, nor is it required that the layer relative thicknesses add to one.
2. Number of integration points to be used through the layer. The default is three points if Simpson's
rule is used and two points if Gauss quadrature is used. The number of integration points must
be an odd number for Simpson's rule, and it determines the number of temperature degrees of
freedom at a node of the element if this section is associated with heat transfer or coupled
temperature-displacement elements. The maximum number of points for Simpson's rule is 99,
and in the case of heat transfer or coupled temperature-displacement elements it is 19. This
number must be less than or equal to 15 for Gauss quadrature.
3. Name of the material forming this layer.
4. Name of the orientation to be used with this layer, an orientation angle, , or the name of a
distribution (Distribution Deﬁnition) that deﬁnes spatially varying orientation angles. If the
name of an orientation is used, the orientation cannot be deﬁned with distributions. Orientation
angles (in degrees) are measured positive counterclockwise relative to the orientation deﬁnition
given with the ORIENTATION parameter. If the ORIENTATION parameter is not included, 
is measured relative to the default shell local directions (see Orientations).
5. Name of the ply. Required only for composite layups deﬁned in Abaqus/CAE. You must specify
ply names that are unique throughout the entire model to ensure the correct display of ply-based
results.
Repeat this data line as often as necessary. Use one data line for each layer of the shell. The order
of the laminated shell layers with respect to the positive direction of the shell normal is defined by the
order of the data lines. If the SYMMETRIC parameter is included, specify only half the layers, from
the bottom layer to the midplane.

• Rate-Dependent Plasticity: Creep and Swelling
Optional parameters:
ALLSDTOL
Include this parameter to indicate that an adaptive automatic damping algorithm will be activated
in this step. Set this parameter equal to the maximum allowable ratio of the stabilization energy to
the total strain energy. The initial damping factor is speciﬁed via the STABILIZE parameter or the
FACTOR parameter. This damping factor will then be adjusted through the step based on the
convergence history and the value of ALLSDTOL. If this parameter is set equal to zero, the adaptive
automatic damping algorithm is not activated; a constant damping factor will be used throughout
the step. If this parameter is included without a speciﬁed value, the default value is 0.05. If this
parameter is omitted but the STABILIZE parameter is included with the default value of dissipated
energy fraction, the adaptive automatic damping algorithm will be activated automatically with
ALLSDTOL=0.05.
This parameter must be used in conjunction with the STABILIZE parameter (see Solving Nonlinear
Problems).
CETOL
This parameter will invoke automatic time incrementation. If the UTOL, DELTMX, and CETOL
parameters are omitted, ﬁxed time increments will be used.
This parameter is meaningful only when the material response includes time-dependent creep
behavior; CETOL controls the accuracy of the creep integration. Set this parameter equal to the
maximum allowable difference in the creep strain increment calculated from the creep strain rates
at the beginning and at the end of the increment (see Rate-Dependent Plasticity: Creep and Swelling).
The tolerance can be calculated by choosing an acceptable stress error tolerance and dividing by a
typical elastic modulus.
CONSOLIDATION
Include this parameter to choose transient (consolidation) analysis. Omit this parameter to choose
steady-state analysis.
CONTINUE
Set CONTINUE=NO (default) to specify that this step will not carry over the damping factors from
the results of the preceding general step. In this case the initial damping factors will be recalculated
based on the declared damping intensity and on the solution of the ﬁrst increment of the step or can
be speciﬁed directly.
Abaqus Keywords Guide
1158
*SOILS

Set CONTINUE=YES to specify that this step will carry over the damping factors from the end of
the immediately preceding general step.
This parameter must be used in conjunction with the ALLSDTOL and the STABILIZE parameters.
DELTMX
This parameter will invoke automatic time incrementation. Set this parameter equal to the maximum
temperature change allowed within an increment. Abaqus/Standard will restrict the time step to
ensure that this value is not exceeded at any node during any increment of the step. If this parameter,
the CETOL parameter, and the UTOL parameter are all omitted in a transient analysis, ﬁxed time
increments will be used, with a constant time increment equal to the initial time increment.
END
This parameter is meaningful only for transient analysis. Set END=PERIOD (default) to analyze a
speciﬁed time period. Set END=SS to end the step when steady state is reached.
CREEP
Set CREEP=NONE to specify that there is no creep or viscoelastic response occurring during this
step even if creep or viscoelastic material properties have been deﬁned.
FACTOR
Set this parameter equal to the damping factor to be used in the automatic damping algorithm (see
Solving Nonlinear Problems) if the problem is expected to be unstable due to local instabilities and
the damping factor calculated by Abaqus/Standard is not suitable. This parameter must be used in
conjunction with the STABILIZE and CONSOLIDATION parameters and overrides the automatic
calculation of the damping factor based on a value of the dissipated energy fraction.
HEAT
This parameter is relevant if there are regions in the model that use coupled temperature–pore
pressure elements; it speciﬁes whether heat transfer effects are to be modeled in these regions.
This parameter is not relevant if only coupled pore pressure–displacement elements are used in a
model.
Set HEAT=YES (default) to specify that heat transfer effects are to be modeled in these regions. In
this case Abaqus/Standard solves the heat transfer equation in conjunction with the mechanical
equilibrium and the ﬂuid ﬂow continuity equations.
Set HEAT=NO to specify that heat transfer will not be modeled in these regions.
SLURRY FLOW
Set SLURRY FLOW=YES (default) to activate the solution of the slurry continuity equation in a
step. In this case, the slurry concentration ﬁeld will evolve with time within the step..
Set SLURRY FLOW=NO to deactivate the solution of the slurry continuity equation in a step. In
this case, the slurry concentration ﬁeld will not evolve in time within the step.
This parameter is relevant only when the slurry concentration degree of freedom is active.
SLURRY MAX
Set this parameter equal to the maximum allowed value of the slurry concentration at a material
point. The default value is 0.67.
This parameter is relevant only when the slurry concentration degree of freedom is active.
SLURRY MIN
Set this parameter equal to the minimum allowed value of the slurry concentration at a material
point. The default value is zero.
This parameter is relevant only when the slurry concentration degree of freedom is active.

STABILIZE
Include this parameter to use automatic stabilization if the problem is expected to be unstable due
to local instabilities. Set this parameter equal to the dissipated energy fraction of the automatic
damping algorithm (see Solving Nonlinear Problems). If this parameter is omitted, the stabilization
algorithm is not activated. If this parameter is included without a speciﬁed value, the default value
of the dissipated energy fraction is 2 × 10−4 and the adaptive automatic damping algorithm will be
activated by default with ALLSDTOL =0.05 in this step; set ALLSDTOL=0 to deactivate the
adaptive automatic damping algorithm. If the FACTOR parameter is used, any value of the dissipated
energy fraction will be overridden by the damping factor.
This parameter can be used only in conjunction with the CONSOLIDATION parameter.
UTOL
This parameter will invoke automatic time incrementation. If the UTOL, DELTMX, and the CETOL
parameters are omitted, ﬁxed time increments will be used.
Set this parameter equal to the maximum pore pressure change permitted in any increment (in
pressure units) in a transient consolidation analysis. Abaqus/Standard will restrict the time step to
ensure that this value will not be exceeded at any node (except nodes with boundary conditions)
during any increment of the analysis.
Set this value equal to any nonzero value in a steady-state analysis (to activate automatic time
incrementation).
Data line to define incrementation for a soils analysis:
First (and only) line:
1. Initial time increment. This value will be modiﬁed as required if the automatic time stepping
scheme is used; it will be used as a constant time increment otherwise.
2. Time period. If END=SS is chosen, the step ends after this time period or when steady-state
conditions are reached, whichever comes ﬁrst.
3. Minimum time increment allowed. If Abaqus/Standard ﬁnds it needs a smaller time increment
than this value, the analysis is terminated. If this entry is zero, a default value of the smaller of
the suggested initial time increment or 10−5 times the total time period is assumed. Only used
for automatic time incrementation.
4. Maximum time increment allowed. If this value is not speciﬁed, the upper limit is the total time
period. Only used for automatic time incrementation.
5. The rate of change of pore pressure with time, used to deﬁne steady state: only needed if END=SS
is chosen. When all nodal wetting liquid pressures are changing at rates below this value, the
solution terminates.
6. The rate of change of temperature with time, used to deﬁne steady state: only needed if END=SS
is chosen. When all nodal temperatures are changing at rates below this value, the solution
terminates.

This parameter outputs the static responses corresponding to all the load cases to a ﬁle named
jobname_RM_stepnumber.sim.
This parameter is ignored if it is speciﬁed for a general analysis.
Optional parameters for a general static analysis:
ADIABATIC
Include this parameter to perform an adiabatic stress analysis. This parameter is relevant only for
isotropic metal plasticity materials with a Mises yield surface and when the *INELASTIC HEAT
FRACTION option has been speciﬁed.
ALLSDTOL
Include this parameter to indicate that an adaptive automatic damping algorithm will be activated
in this step. Set this parameter equal to the maximum allowable ratio of the stabilization energy to
the total strain energy. The initial damping factor is speciﬁed via the STABILIZE parameter or the
FACTOR parameter. This damping factor will then be adjusted through the step based on the
convergence history and the value of ALLSDTOL. If this parameter is set equal to zero, the adaptive
automatic damping algorithm is not activated; a constant damping factor will be used throughout
the step. If this parameter is included without a speciﬁed value, the default value is 0.05. If this
parameter is omitted but the STABILIZE parameter is included with the default value of dissipated
energy fraction, the adaptive automatic damping algorithm will be activated automatically with
ALLSDTOL=0.05.
This parameter must be used in conjunction with the STABILIZE parameter (see Solving Nonlinear
Problems).

the results of the preceding general step. In this case the initial damping factors will be recalculated

*STATIC

based on the declared damping intensity and on the solution of the ﬁrst increment of the step or can
be speciﬁed directly.
Set CONTINUE=YES to specify that this step will carry over the damping factors from the end of
the immediately preceding general step.
This parameter must be used in conjunction with the ALLSDTOL and the STABILIZE parameters.
DIRECT
This parameter selects direct user control of the incrementation through the step. If this parameter
is used, constant increments of the size deﬁned by the ﬁrst item on the data line are used. If this
parameter is omitted, Abaqus/Standard will choose the increments (after trying the user's initial time
increment for the ﬁrst attempt at the ﬁrst increment).
The parameter can have the value NO STOP. If this value is included, the solution to an increment
is accepted after the maximum number of iterations allowed has been completed (as deﬁned by the
*CONTROLS option), even if the equilibrium tolerances are not satisﬁed. Very small increments
and a minimum of two iterations are usually necessary if this value is used. This approach is not
recommended; it should be used only in special cases when the analyst has a thorough understanding
of how to interpret results obtained in this way.
FACTOR
Set this parameter equal to the damping factor to be used in the automatic damping algorithm (see
Solving Nonlinear Problems) if the problem is expected to be unstable due to local instabilities and
the damping factor calculated by Abaqus is not suitable. This parameter must be used in conjunction
with the STABILIZE parameter and overrides the automatic calculation of the damping factor based
on a value of the dissipated energy fraction.
This parameter cannot be used if the RIKS parameter is included.
FULLY PLASTIC
This parameter is relevant only for cases where “fully plastic” analysis is required with deformation
theory plasticity. For that purpose set this parameter equal to the name of the element set being
monitored for fully plastic behavior.
The step will end when the solutions at all constitutive calculation points in the element set are fully
plastic (deﬁned by the equivalent strain being 10 times the offset yield strain). The step will end
before this occurs if either the maximum number of increments given on the *STEP option or the
time period given on the data line of *STATIC is exceeded.
LONG TERM
Include this parameter to obtain the fully relaxed long-term elastic solution with time-domain
viscoelasticity or the long-term elastic-plastic solution for two-layer viscoplasticity. If the LONG
TERM parameter is omitted, the instantaneous elastic solution is obtained for time-domain
viscoelasticity and the combined response of the elastic-plastic and elastic-viscous networks is
obtained for two-layer viscoplasticity. The parameter is relevant only for time-domain viscoelastic
and two-layer viscoplastic materials.
RATE DEPENDENCE
Set RATE DEPENDENCE=ON (default) to consider the strain rate–dependence when evaluating
the yield stress of a material and to consider the slip rate–dependence when evaluating the friction
coefﬁcient.
Set RATE DEPENDENCE=OFF to ignore the strain rate–dependence when evaluating the yield
stress of a material and to ignore the slip rate–dependence when evaluating the friction coefﬁcient.

*STATIC

Include this parameter to use the modiﬁed Riks method for proportional loading cases (Unstable
Collapse and Postbuckling Analysis).
STABILIZE
Include this parameter to use automatic stabilization if the problem is expected to be unstable due
to local instabilities. Set this parameter equal to the dissipated energy fraction of the automatic
damping algorithm (see Solving Nonlinear Problems). If this parameter is omitted, the stabilization
algorithm is not activated. If this parameter is included without a speciﬁed value, the default value
of the dissipated energy fraction is 
 and the adaptive automatic damping algorithm will be
activated by default with ALLSDTOL =0.05 in this step; set ALLSDTOL=0 to deactivate the
adaptive automatic damping algorithm. If the FACTOR parameter is used, any value of the dissipated
energy fraction will be overridden by the damping factor.
This parameter cannot be used if the RIKS parameter is included.

First (and only) line:
1. Initial time increment. This value will be modiﬁed as required if the automatic time stepping
scheme is used or will be used as the constant time increment if the DIRECT parameter is used.

step is assumed.
2. Time period of the step. If this entry is zero or is not speciﬁed, a default value of 
 is assumed.
3. Minimum time increment allowed. Only used for automatic time incrementation. If
Abaqus/Standard ﬁnds it needs a smaller time increment than this value, the analysis is terminated.
If this entry is zero, a default value of the smaller of the suggested initial time increment or 10−5

this option. See Steady-State Detection for more information regarding steady-state norm deﬁnitions.
Set SAMPLING=PLANE BY PLANE to calculate the steady-state norms as each plane of elements
crosses the exit plane. This method should be used only for non-Eulerian analyses with uniform
planes of elements sequentially passing the exit plane.
Set SAMPLING=UNIFORM to calculate the steady-state norms at an interval deﬁned by the time
required for material to ﬂow through an element of average length. This interval is determined at
the beginning of the step and remains constant throughout the step. This method should be used
only for analyses with material ﬂowing in and out of Eulerian boundary regions in the primary
direction.

First (and only) line:
1. First direction cosine of primary direction.
2. Second direction cosine of primary direction.
3. Third direction cosine of primary direction.
4. Global X-coordinate of a point on the cutting plane.

Optional and mutually exclusive parameters:
If none of these optional mutually exclusive parameters is speciﬁed, Abaqus/Standard assumes MODE
BASED=CONVENTIONAL.
DIRECT
Include this parameter to compute the steady-state harmonic response directly in terms of the physical
degrees of freedom of the model. This usually makes the procedure signiﬁcantly more expensive,
but it can be used if model parameters depend on frequency, if the stiffness of the system is
unsymmetric and the unsymmetric terms are important, or if the system contains discrete damping
(such as dashpot elements).
MODE BASED
Include this parameter to compute the steady-state harmonic response using the mode superposition
method.
Set MODE BASED=CONVENTIONAL (default) to select the conventional modal solver that solves
the system of linear equations of motion for every frequency directly by factorizing the complex
matrix.
Set MODE BASED=SPECTRAL to select the spectral modal solver that uses the dense complex
eigenvalue problem solution to represent the steady-state harmonic response of the damped model.
This solver can perform better than the conventional solver in analyses with many modes, frequency
points, and load cases for ﬁnite element models with special, but commonly used, damping properties
(for example, no viscous damping in the model, viscous damping speciﬁed for relatively small
portions of the model, or viscous modal damping speciﬁed for several selected modes).
SUBSPACE PROJECTION
Include this parameter to compute the steady-state harmonic response on the basis of the subspace
projection method. In this case a direct solution is obtained for the model projected onto the
eigenvectors obtained in the preceding *FREQUENCY step. This is a cost-effective approach to
including consideration of unsymmetric stiffness and frequency-dependent model parameters. It is
more expensive than the modal superposition method but less expensive than the direct-solution
method.

*STEADY STATE DYNAMICS

Set SUBSPACE PROJECTION=ALL FREQUENCIES (default) if the projection of the dynamic
equations onto the modal subspace is to be performed at each frequency requested on the data lines.
Set SUBSPACE PROJECTION=CONSTANT if a single projection of the dynamic equations onto
the modal subspace is to be used for all frequencies requested on the data lines. The projection is
performed using model properties evaluated at the center frequency determined on a logarithmic or
linear scale depending on the value of the FREQUENCY SCALE parameter.
Set SUBSPACE PROJECTION=EIGENFREQUENCY if the projections onto the modal subspace
of the dynamic equations are to be performed at each eigenfrequency within the requested ranges
and at the eigenfrequencies immediately outside these ranges. The projections are then interpolated
at each frequency requested on the data lines. The interpolation is done on a logarithmic or linear
scale depending on the value of the FREQUENCY SCALE parameter.
Set SUBSPACE PROJECTION=PROPERTY CHANGE to select how often subspace projections
onto the modal subspace are performed based on material property changes as a function of frequency.
The interpolation is done on a logarithmic or linear scale depending on the value of the FREQUENCY
SCALE parameter.
Set SUBSPACE PROJECTION=RANGE if the projections onto the modal subspace of the dynamic
equations are to be performed at the lower limit of each frequency range and at the upper limit of
the last frequency range. The interpolation is done on a linear scale. This value can be used only
with the SIM architecture.
Optional parameters:
DAMPING CHANGE
This parameter is relevant only for SUBSPACE PROJECTION=PROPERTY CHANGE.
Set this parameter equal to the maximum relative change in damping material properties before a
new projection is to be performed. The default value is 0.1.
FREQUENCY SCALE
This parameter is relevant only if INTERVAL=EIGENFREQUENCY or INTERVAL=RANGE. If
INTERVAL=SPREAD linear scale is used.
Set this parameter equal to LOGARITHMIC (default) or LINEAR to determine whether a logarithmic
or linear scale is used for output. If the SUBSPACE PROJECTION parameter is included and is
set equal to either EIGENFREQUENCY or PROPERTY CHANGE, the same scale will be used
for the interpolation of the subspace projections.
FRICTION DAMPING
This parameter is relevant only if the DIRECT or the SUBSPACE PROJECTION parameter is
included.
Set FRICTION DAMPING=NO (default) or YES to ignore or to include friction-induced damping
effects at the slipping contact interface for which a velocity differential is imposed.
INTERVAL
Set INTERVAL=EIGENFREQUENCY if the frequency ranges speciﬁed on each data line are to
be subdivided using the system's eigenfrequencies. This option requires a preceding *FREQUENCY
step and is the default if the DIRECT parameter is omitted.
Set INTERVAL=RANGE if the frequency range speciﬁed on each data line is to be used directly.
This option is the default if the DIRECT parameter is included.
Set INTERVAL=SPREAD to deﬁne frequency points around eigenfrequencies found in the frequency
ranges speciﬁed on each data line. This option requires a preceding *FREQUENCY step.

REAL ONLY
This parameter is relevant only if the DIRECT or the SUBSPACE PROJECTION parameter is
included.
Include this parameter if damping terms are to be ignored so that a real, rather than a complex,
system matrix is factored. This option can reduce computational time signiﬁcantly for the DIRECT
procedure and, to a lesser extent, for the SUBSPACE PROJECTION procedure.
STIFFNESS CHANGE
This parameter is relevant only for SUBSPACE PROJECTION=PROPERTY CHANGE.
Set this parameter equal to the maximum relative change in stiffness material properties before a
new projection is to be performed. The default value is 0.1.
Data lines for a steady-state dynamics analysis if INTERVAL=EIGENFREQUENCY:
First line:
1. Lower limit of frequency range or a single frequency, in cycles/time.
2. Upper limit of frequency range, in cycles/time. If this value is given as zero, it is assumed that
results are required at only one frequency and the remaining data items on the line are ignored.
3. Number of points in the frequency range at which results should be given, including the end
points. It is the number of points from the lower limit of the frequency range to the ﬁrst
eigenfrequency in the range; in each interval from eigenfrequency to eigenfrequency; and from
the highest eigenfrequency in the range to the high limit of the frequency range. The minimum
value is 2. If the value given is less than 2 (or omitted), the default value of 20 points is assumed.
4. Bias parameter. This parameter is useful only if results are requested at four or more frequency
points. It is used to bias the results points toward the ends of the intervals so that better resolution
is obtained there. This is generally useful since the ends of each interval are the eigenfrequencies
where the response amplitudes vary most rapidly. The default bias parameter is 3.0.
5. Frequency scale factor. All the frequency points, except the lower and upper limit of the frequency
range, are scaled by this factor. The default frequency scale factor is 1.0.

5. Frequency scale factor. All the frequency points are scaled by this factor. The default frequency
scale factor is 1.0.

*STEADY STATE TRANSPORT: Steady-state transport analysis.
This option is used to indicate that the step should be analyzed as a steady-state transport analysis.
Products: Abaqus/Standard
Type:  History data
Level:  Step
References:
• Steady-State Transport Analysis
• Symmetric Model Generation
Optional parameters:
ALLSDTOL
Include this parameter to indicate that an adaptive automatic damping algorithm will be activated
in this step. Set this parameter equal to the maximum allowable ratio of the stabilization energy to
the total strain energy. The initial damping factor is speciﬁed via the STABILIZE parameter or the
FACTOR parameter. This damping factor will then be adjusted through the step based on the
convergence history and the value of ALLSDTOL. If this parameter is set equal to zero, the adaptive
automatic damping algorithm is not activated; a constant damping factor will be used throughout
the step. If this parameter is included without a speciﬁed value, the default value is 0.05. If this
parameter is omitted but the STABILIZE parameter is included with the default value of dissipated
energy fraction, the adaptive automatic damping algorithm will be activated automatically with
ALLSDTOL=0.05.
This parameter must be used in conjunction with the STABILIZE parameter (see Solving Nonlinear
Problems).
CONTINUE
Set CONTINUE=NO (default) to specify that this step is not to carry over the damping factors from
the results of the preceding general step. In this case the initial damping factors will be recalculated
based on the declared damping intensity and on the solution of the ﬁrst increment of the step or can
be speciﬁed directly.
Set CONTINUE=YES to specify that this step is to carry over the damping factors from the end of
the immediately preceding general step.
This parameter must be used in conjunction with the ALLSDTOL and the STABILIZE parameters.
DIRECT
This parameter selects direct user control of the incrementation through the step. If this parameter
is used, constant increments of the size deﬁned by the ﬁrst item on the data line are used. If this
parameter is omitted, Abaqus/Standard will choose the increments (after trying the user's initial time
increment for the ﬁrst attempt at the ﬁrst increment).
The parameter can have the value NO STOP. If this value is included, the solution to an increment
is accepted after the maximum number of iterations allowed has been completed (as deﬁned by the
*CONTROLS option), even if the equilibrium tolerances are not satisﬁed. Very small increments
and a minimum of two iterations are usually necessary if this value is used. This approach is not
recommended; it should be used only in special cases when the analyst has a thorough understanding
of how to interpret results obtained in this way.
1191
*STEADY STATE TRANSPORT

ELSET
Set this parameter equal to the name of an element set for which the rigid body motion will be
described in a spatial or Eulerian manner. The rest of the elements in the model will be treated in a
classical Lagrangian manner. Only one Eulerian element set can be speciﬁed in the whole model.
If this parameter is omitted, the rigid body motion in the whole model will be described in a spatial
or Eulerian manner.
FACTOR
Set this parameter equal to the damping factor to be used in the automatic damping algorithm (see
Solving Nonlinear Problems) if the problem is expected to be unstable due to local instabilities and
the damping factor calculated by Abaqus is not suitable. This parameter must be used in conjunction
with the STABILIZE parameter and overrides the automatic calculation of the damping factor based
on a value of the dissipated energy fraction.
INERTIA
Include this parameter to indicate that inertia effects must be accounted for.
Set INERTIA=NO (default) to ignore inertia effects.
Set INERTIA=YES to include inertia effects. This setting includes the inertia load stiffness terms.
At high rolling speeds these terms can improve the convergence behavior of the simulation
signiﬁcantly. Therefore, it is recommended that you include these terms.
Set INERTIA=LOW SPEED to include inertia effects but ignore unsymmetric inertia load stiffness
matrix terms. The unsymmetric inertia load stiffness terms increase the solver time for each iteration.
At low rolling speeds the inertia load stiffness terms are often not critical for convergence and using
INERTIA=LOW SPEED may shorten the simulation time.
INERTIA STABILIZATION FACTOR
Set this parameter equal to the stabilization factor to use in the inertia calculations for ﬁrst-order
elements in three-dimensional meshes created by revolving an axisymmetric mesh cross-section
during symmetric model generation (see Inertia Stabilization). This factor must be set to a value
greater than or equal to zero. By default, it is set to one.
Set this parameter equal to zero to turn off inertia stabilization.
The inertia stabilization factor is not related to the STABILIZE parameter; however, when inertia
stabilization is used, it is often not necessary to include automatic stabilization.
LONG TERM
Include this parameter to indicate that there is no viscoelastic or viscoplastic material response
during this step. The solution must be based on the long-term elastic moduli if the material description
includes viscoelastic material properties or be based on the long-term response of the elastic-plastic
network alone if the two-layer viscoplastic material model is used.
MULLINS
Include this parameter when the Mullins effect material model is used to indicate how the Mullins
effect should be applied over the step.
Set MULLINS=RAMP to indicate that the Mullins effect should be ramped up over the time period
of the current step.
Set MULLINS=STEP (default) to indicate that the Mullins effect should be applied instantaneously
at the beginning of the current step.
PASS BY PASS
Include this parameter to indicate that a quasi-steady-state (pass-by-pass) procedure will be used to
obtain the steady-state solution.
Abaqus Keywords Guide
1192
*STEADY STATE TRANSPORT

If this parameter is omitted, the steady-state solution will be obtained directly.
STABILIZE
Include this parameter to use automatic stabilization if the problem is expected to be unstable due
to local instabilities. Set this parameter equal to the dissipated energy fraction of the automatic
damping algorithm (see Solving Nonlinear Problems). If this parameter is omitted, the stabilization
algorithm is not activated. If this parameter is included without a speciﬁed value, the default value
of the dissipated energy fraction is 
 and the adaptive automatic damping algorithm will be
activated by default with ALLSDTOL =0.05 in this step; set ALLSDTOL=0 to deactivate the
adaptive automatic damping algorithm. If the FACTOR parameter is used, any value of the dissipated
energy fraction will be overridden by the damping factor.
Data line to define a steady-state transport analysis:
First (and only) line:
1. Initial time increment. This value will be modiﬁed as required if the automatic time stepping
scheme is used or will be used as the constant time increment if the DIRECT parameter is used.
2. Time period of the step.
3. Minimum time increment allowed. Only used for automatic time incrementation. If
Abaqus/Standard ﬁnds it needs a smaller time increment than this value, the analysis is terminated.
If this entry is zero, a default value of the smaller of the suggested initial time increment or 10−5
times the total time period is assumed.
4. Maximum time increment allowed. Only used for automatic time incrementation. If this value
is not speciﬁed, no upper limit is imposed.

Optional parameters:
AMPLITUDE
This parameter deﬁnes the default amplitude variation for loading magnitudes during the step.
Set AMPLITUDE=STEP if the load is to be applied instantaneously at the start of the step and
remain constant throughout the step.
Set AMPLITUDE=RAMP if the load magnitude is to vary linearly over the step, from the value at
the end of the previous step (or zero, at the start of the analysis) to the value given on the loading
option.
If this parameter is omitted, the default amplitude choice depends on the procedure chosen, as shown
in Deﬁning an Analysis. The default amplitude variation can be overwritten for individual loadings
by using the AMPLITUDE parameter on the loading options (Amplitude Curves).
This parameter is rarely needed, and changing the defaults might cause problems. For example, the
automatic load incrementation scheme in procedures without a real time scale (such as the *STATIC
option) applies the loads gradually by incrementing the normalized time scale. The use of
AMPLITUDE=STEP speciﬁes that the entire load will be applied immediately, so Abaqus/Standard
might not be able to choose suitable small increments if the loading causes strongly nonlinear
response.
CONVERT SDI
This parameter determines how severe discontinuities (such as contact changes) are accounted for
during nonlinear analysis.
Set CONVERT SDI=YES (default) to use local convergence criteria to determine whether a new
iteration is required. Abaqus/Standard will determine the maximum penetration and estimated force
errors associated with severe discontinuities and check whether these errors are within the tolerances.
Hence, a solution might converge if the severe discontinuities are small.
Abaqus Keywords Guide
1194
*STEP

Set CONVERT SDI=NO to force a new iteration if severe discontinuities occur during an iteration,
regardless of the magnitude of the penetration and force errors. This option also changes some time
incrementation parameters and uses different criteria to determine whether to do another iteration
or to make a new attempt with a smaller increment size.
If the CONVERT SDI parameter is omitted, Abaqus/Standard will use the value speciﬁed in the
previous general analysis step. An exception is the ﬁrst new step of a restart analysis, which will
use CONVERT SDI=YES by default regardless of the setting in the previous step.
This parameter has no relevance and will be ignored for heat transfer analysis and linear perturbation
steps.
DSA
This parameter applies only to Abaqus/Design.
Set DSA=YES to activate design sensitivity analysis for the step. Once DSA is activated in a general
step, it remains active in all subsequent general steps until it is deactivated in a subsequent general
step by setting DSA=NO. Once DSA is activated in a perturbation step, it remains active in all
subsequent consecutive perturbation steps until it is deactivated in a subsequent consecutive
perturbation step. However, if DSA is activated in a step whose procedure is not supported for DSA,
DSA will be deactivated until it is activated again by setting DSA=YES.
EXTRAPOLATION
This parameter is useful only for nonlinear analyses.
Set EXTRAPOLATION=LINEAR (default for procedures other than *DYNAMIC,
APPLICATION=TRANSIENT FIDELITY) to indicate that the process is essentially monotonic,
so that Abaqus/Standard should use a 100% linear extrapolation, in time, of the previous incremental
solution to begin the nonlinear equation solution for the current increment (a 1% extrapolation is
used with the Riks method).
Set EXTRAPOLATION=PARABOLIC to indicate that the process should use a quadratic
displacement-based extrapolation, in time, of the previous two incremental solutions to begin the
nonlinear equation solution for the current increment.
Set EXTRAPOLATION=VELOCITY PARABOLIC (available for *DYNAMIC procedure only
and default for the *DYNAMICAPPLICATION=TRANSIENT FIDELITY procedure) to indicate
that the process should use a quadratic velocity-based extrapolation, in time, of the previous
incremental solutions to begin the nonlinear equation solution for the current increment.
Set EXTRAPOLATION=NO to suppress any extrapolation.
INC
Set this parameter equal to the maximum number of increments in a step (or in a single loading
cycle for direct cyclic analysis). This value is only an upper bound. The default value is 100.
The INC parameter has no effect in procedures where automatic incrementation cannot be used (for
example, *BUCKLE, *STEADY STATE DYNAMICS, and *MODAL DYNAMIC).
NAME
Set this parameter equal to a label that will be used to refer to the step on the output database. Step
names in the same input ﬁle must be unique. Step names from the original input ﬁle can be reused
in a restart input ﬁle.
NLGEOM
Omit this parameter or set NLGEOM=NO to perform a geometrically linear analysis during the
current step. Include this parameter or set NLGEOM=YES to indicate that geometric nonlinearity
should be accounted for during the step (stress analysis, fully coupled thermal-stress analysis, and
1195
Abaqus Keywords Guide
*STEP

coupled thermal-electrical-stress analysis only). Once the NLGEOM option has been switched on,
it will be active during all subsequent steps in the analysis.
PERTURBATION
Include this parameter to indicate that this is a linear perturbation step. For this type of analysis
Abaqus/Standard expects that load, boundary, and temperature changes should be given and that
the results will be changes relative to the previous step. Please read the discussions in General and
Perturbation Procedures, Mesh-to-Mesh Solution Mapping, and About Loads before using this
option.
SENSITIVITY
Set SENSITIVITY=ADJOINT to output adjoint design sensitivities for topology, sizing, lattice, or
shape optimization.
If this parameter is omitted, adjoint design sensitivities are not output.
SOLVER
Set SOLVER=ITERATIVE to use the iterative linear equation solver. Please read the discussion
in Iterative Linear Equation Solver before using this option.
You cannot use the iterative solver and the direct sparse solver together in the same input ﬁle.
If this parameter is omitted for the ﬁrst step, the default direct sparse solver is used. If this parameter
is omitted for a step after the ﬁrst step, the solver for the previous step is used.
UNSYMM
Set UNSYMM=YES to indicate that unsymmetric matrix storage and solution should be used.
Set UNSYMM=NO to indicate that symmetric storage and solution should be used.
The default value for this parameter depends on the model and procedure options used. The user is
allowed to change the default value only in certain cases. If the UNSYMM parameter is not used
in such cases, Abaqus/Standard will use the value speciﬁed in the previous general analysis step.
See Deﬁning an Analysis for a more detailed discussion of the use of this parameter.

*STEP CONTROL: Control progress of the simulation based on the solution
state.
This option is used to control the progress of a simulation based on the solution state. If you specify a threshold
value for a particular measure of the solution state that has been associated with a sensor deﬁnition, the action
taken on reaching the threshold can include terminating the current step or terminating the analysis.
You can deﬁne an action for a step control to end the current step or analysis when the algebraic or the absolute
value of the sensor has reached either a maximum or a minimum threshold. You can also specify that
Abaqus/Standard utilizes an alternative time incrementation that is smaller than that computed by the normal

Optional parameters:
ACTION
By default, the step control deﬁnition is utilized for time increment reﬁnement when the value of
the sensor is within a speciﬁed interval. In this case, no threshold value of the sensor is necessary.
The nondefault actions of a step control deﬁnition require the speciﬁcation of a threshold value of
the sensor.
Set ACTION=CONTINUE (default) to trigger time increment reﬁnement when the value of the
sensor is within a speciﬁed interval. It must be used in conjunction with DT REFINEMENT=YES.
Set ACTION=END ANALYSIS to end the analysis completely when the sensor reaches a speciﬁed
threshold value.
Set ACTION=END STEP to conclude the current step and to continue to the next step when the
sensor reaches a speciﬁed threshold value.
DT REFINEMENT
You can specify two limits and control the time incrementation when the sensor value is within the
range deﬁned by the two limits to get ﬁner resolution on the solution within a speciﬁed range of
values for the sensor while using normal time increments outside of this range. Alternatively, you
can specify a limit and a threshold value and control the time incrementation when the sensor value

be used.
TOLERANCE
Set this parameter equal to the tolerance to be used to determine when the sensor has reached the
threshold value. The TOLERANCE parameter must be used in conjunction with DT

Abaqus/Standard enforces the relative error in the sensor value with respect to its threshold value
to be less than the speciﬁed tolerance. The default value of the tolerance is 0.001.

*STEP CYCLING

*STEP CYCLING CONTROL: Specify sensor-based or contact wear-based
criteria to control early termination of step cycling.
This option is used to specify a sensor-based or a contact wear-based criterion to trigger early termination of
step cycling before a set number of step cycles are complete.
For a sensor-based criterion, the trigger involves satisfying a termination condition that depends on the sensor
state and a sensor threshold value. Alternatively, you can specify accumulated contact wear distances and a
threshold wear distance to trigger early termination of step cycling. For the wear-based criterion, you also specify
a target maximum accumulated wear distance per step cycle to determine a step cycle scale factor used for wear
calculations in the next step cycle.
This option can be activated in a step only if the step is part of a step cycle deﬁnition. You can include this option
multiple times within a step, with different control deﬁnitions; early termination might be triggered by any of
the deﬁnitions.

FREQUENCY BASED
This parameter is relevant to frequency-based substructures. Frequency-based substructures are
used only in a direct steady-state dynamic analysis (see Direct-Solution Steady-State Dynamic
Analysis). All other analyses use conventional substructures regardless of the availability of
frequency-based substructures.
Set FREQUENCY BASED=ALL FREQUENCIES to use the frequency-based substructure at all
frequency points of interest. If the frequency-based substructure is not available at a certain frequency,
an operator-averaging-based approximate solution is given at that frequency. If a frequency of
interest is beyond the range of frequencies at which the frequency-based substructure is constructed
at generation, Abaqus issues an error.
Set FREQUENCY BASED=NO FREQUENCIES to disable the use of the frequency-based
substructure at any frequency. The conventional substructure is used instead at all frequencies.
Set FREQUENCY BASED=MATCHED FREQUENCIES (default) to use the frequency-based
substructure only at frequencies at which the frequency-based substructure is constructed at
generation. At all nonmatching frequencies, the conventional substructure is used.

type.
Set COMBINE=INTERSECTION to create a surface based on the intersection of two surfaces of
the same type.

CROP
Include this parameter to create a new surface that will contain only those faces from an existing
surface that have nodes in a speciﬁed rectangular box.
Only the NAME parameter and, in cavity radiation simulations, the PROPERTY parameter can be
used in conjunction with this parameter.
DEFINITION
This parameter is relevant only for surfaces deﬁned using TYPE=CUTTING SURFACE.
Set DEFINITION=COORDINATES (default) to deﬁne the cutting plane by giving the coordinates
of a point on the cutting plane and the normal to the cutting plane.
Set DEFINITION=NODES to deﬁne the cutting plane by giving global node numbers for point a
on the cutting plane and point b that lies off the cutting plane with the cutting plane normal determined
by the vector from a to b.
FILLET RADIUS
This parameter can be used with TYPE=SEGMENTS, TYPE=CYLINDER, or TYPE=
REVOLUTION to deﬁne a radius of curvature to smooth discontinuities between adjoining
straight-line segments, adjoining circular-arc segments, and adjoining straight-line and circular-arc
segments.
INTERNAL
Abaqus/CAE uses the INTERNAL parameter to identify surfaces that are created internally. The
INTERNAL parameter is used only in models deﬁned in terms of an assembly of part instances.
The default is to omit the INTERNAL parameter.
REGION TYPE
This parameter is relevant only for surfaces deﬁned on the boundary of an adaptive mesh domain.
A surface deﬁned in the interior of an adaptive mesh domain will move independently of the material
unless the surface is constrained by mesh constraints. See Deﬁning ALE Adaptive Mesh Domains
in Abaqus/Explicit.
Set REGION TYPE=LAGRANGIAN to create a Lagrangian boundary region. The edge of a
Lagrangian boundary region will follow the material while allowing adaptive meshing along the
edge and within the interior of the region.
Set REGION TYPE=SLIDING (default) to create a sliding boundary region. The edge of a sliding
boundary region will slide over the material. Adaptive meshing will occur on the edge and within
the interior of the region. Mesh constraints are typically applied on the edge of a sliding boundary
region to ﬁx it spatially.
Set REGION TYPE=EULERIAN to create an Eulerian boundary region in an adaptive mesh domain.
This option is used to create a boundary region across which material can ﬂow. Mesh constraints
must be used normal to an Eulerian boundary region to allow material to ﬂow through the region.
If no mesh constraints are applied, an Eulerian boundary region will behave in the same way as a
sliding boundary region.
TRIM
Set TRIM=YES to invoke trimming of open free surfaces. Set TRIM=NO to suppress surface
trimming. The default value is TRIM=YES unless the surface is used as a main surface in a
ﬁnite-sliding contact formulation in Abaqus/Standard or the surface is used with the contact pair
algorithm in Abaqus/Explicit. TRIM=YES has no effect on surfaces used with the contact pair
algorithm in Abaqus/Explicit.

line segments, which are given in an 
 plane and are rotated about an axis.
Set TYPE=CUTTING SURFACE to generate an interior element-based surface using a cutting
plane passing through an element set. The generated surface is an approximation to the cutting plane.
Set TYPE=EULERIAN MATERIAL to deﬁne a surface on the exterior boundary of an Eulerian
material instance. This option applies only to Abaqus/Explicit.
Set TYPE=USER to deﬁne an analytical surface via user subroutine RSURFU in Abaqus/Standard.
Set TYPE=XFEM to generate a crack surface for enriched cracked elements. This option applies
only to Abaqus/Standard. Crack surfaces for XFEM are not supported with the *CONTACT PAIR
option.
Additional optional parameters used for contact pair analyses in Abaqus/Explicit:
MAX RATIO
Set this parameter equal to the upper bound of the ratio of a facet's contact thickness to its minimum
edge (or diagonal) length. This ratio is computed after the SCALE THICK parameter is applied to
the contact thickness. The contact thickness for individual facets will be adjusted, if necessary, to
conform to this maximum ratio.
If this parameter is omitted, no upper bound will be enforced. If this parameter is included without
a value speciﬁed, the default value is 0.6.
NO OFFSET
Include this parameter to indicate that this surface will ignore the midplane offset of any shell,
membrane, or rigid elements that form the surface.
NO THICK
Include this parameter to indicate that this surface will ignore the thickness of any shell, membrane,
or rigid elements that form the surface. A surface deﬁned with this parameter cannot be used to
deﬁne a double-sided surface or for self-contact.
SCALE THICK
This parameter applies only when the surface is used with the *CONTACT PAIR option.
Set this parameter equal to the amount by which to scale the thicknesses of the underlying elements
to compute the contact thicknesses. The default is 1.0 (i.e., no scaling).

area used for contact pair calculations for node-based surface nodes is always set to 1.0 regardless
of the value speciﬁed here. If the surface is used in a *COUPLING or *SHELL TO SOLID

*SURFACE BEHAVIOR: Define alternative pressure-overclosure relationships
for contact.
This option is used to modify the default hard contact pressure-overclosure relationship in a mechanical contact
analysis. Mechanical interactions normal to the surfaces are inﬂuenced by this option. It must be used in
conjunction with the *SURFACE INTERACTION option or in an Abaqus/Standard analysis with the *GAP
option or the *INTERFACE option. By default, Abaqus/Standard will determine whether the contact constraint
will be enforced with or without a Lagrange multiplier. You can use the *CONTACT CONTROLS option to
override the default.

Optional, mutually exclusive parameters:
AUGMENTED LAGRANGE
This parameter applies only to Abaqus/Standard analyses with a default “hard” pressure-overclosure
relationship.
Include this parameter to choose the augmented Lagrange method for enforcement of the contact
constraint. See Contact Constraint Enforcement Methods in Abaqus/Standard for a discussion of
the default penalty stiffness and penetration tolerance associated with this method (the default penalty
stiffness used by this method is often stiffer than that with the straight penalty method). You can
specify or modify the penalty stiffness on the data line.
DIRECT
This parameter applies only to Abaqus/Standard analyses.
Include this parameter to choose direct enforcement of contact constraints without approximation
or use of augmentation iterations.
PENALTY
This parameter applies only to Abaqus/Standard analyses with a default “hard” pressure-overclosure
relationship.
Set PENALTY=LINEAR (default) to choose the linear penalty method for enforcement of the
contact constraint. See Contact Constraint Enforcement Methods in Abaqus/Standard for a discussion
of the default linear penalty stiffness. You can specify or modify the penalty stiffness on the data
line.
Abaqus Keywords Guide
1242
*SURFACE BEHAVIOR

Set PENALTY=NONLINEAR to choose the nonlinear penalty method for enforcement of the
contact constraint. See Contact Constraint Enforcement Methods in Abaqus/Standard for a discussion
of the default nonlinear penalty stiffness. You can specify or modify the ﬁnal nonlinear penalty
stiffness and other nonlinear penalty control parameters on the data line.
Optional parameters:
NO SEPARATION
Include this parameter to prevent any separation of the two surfaces once contact has been established.
PRESSURE-OVERCLOSURE
Use this parameter to choose a contact pressure-overclosure relationship other than the default hard
contact.
Set PRESSURE-OVERCLOSURE=HARD (default) to choose a pressure-overclosure relationship
without physical softening. Some numerical softening will occur if a penalty or augmented Lagrange
constraint enforcement method is used.
Set PRESSURE-OVERCLOSURE=EXPONENTIAL to deﬁne an exponential pressure-overclosure
relationship.
Set PRESSURE-OVERCLOSURE=LINEAR to deﬁne a linear pressure-overclosure relationship.
Set PRESSURE-OVERCLOSURE=SCALE FACTOR to deﬁne a piecewise linear
pressure-overclosure relationship based on scaling the default contact stiffness. This option is
available only for the general contact algorithm in Abaqus/Explicit.
Set PRESSURE-OVERCLOSURE=TABULAR to deﬁne a piecewise linear pressure-overclosure
relationship in tabular form.
Set PRESSURE-OVERCLOSURE=HERTZ to deﬁne a Hertz-type pressure-overclosure relationship
for discrete element method analysis.
Set PRESSURE-OVERCLOSURE=JKR to deﬁne a JKR-type pressure-overclosure relationship
for discrete element method analysis.
Set PRESSURE-OVERCLOSURE=LKM to deﬁne contact for lumped kinetic molecular method
analysis.
If a contact area is not deﬁned, such as might occur for node-based surfaces or for GAP- or ITT-type
contact elements, “pressure” should be interpreted as force. For contact with three-dimensional
beams or trusses, “pressure” should be interpreted as force per unit length.
When used to modify the default surface behavior, the PRESSURE-OVERCLOSURE parameter
cannot be used with the NO SEPARATION parameter in an Abaqus/Standard analysis; the same
restriction applies to Abaqus/Explicit when general contact is used except for
PRESSURE-OVERCLOSURE=LINEAR.
Optional data line for AUGMENTED LAGRANGE and PENALTY=LINEAR:
First (and only) line:
1. User-deﬁned linear penalty stiffness. If this ﬁeld is left blank or is zero, the linear penalty stiffness
has the default value or is multiplied by the scale factor given in the third ﬁeld of the data line.

. When using penalty contact, large stiffness values obtained
from the exponential law might signiﬁcantly lower the stable time increment size. Choose a
suitable maximum stiffness to mitigate this effect (see Figure 2). By default,

and must be greater than one.

rate of slip (see Filtering Rates of Relative Motion). The default value is 0.9.
RATE INTERPOLATION
This parameter applies only to Abaqus/Explicit analyses using general contact and inﬂuences the
interpolation of friction coefﬁcients and cohesive damage parameters with respect to the slip rate

Set RATE INTERPOLATION=LINEAR to use linear interpolation with respect to slip rate and
rate of separation dependencies.
TRACKING THICKNESS
Set this parameter equal to the thickness that determines the contacting surfaces to be tracked.

less than the default. This parameter extends the range over which contact opening distance (COPEN)
output is provided for separated surfaces.
In Abaqus/Explicit this parameter also applies if user subroutine VUINTER or VUINTERACTION
is in effect. Only contacting surfaces whose proximity is within this thickness are available for

for this parameter cannot be negative. An internal default value is used if a zero value is input or if
the parameter is omitted.

Include this parameter when the interface stiffness matrix is not symmetric. This parameter causes
Abaqus/Standard to use its unsymmetric equation solution procedures.

deﬁned in user subroutine UINTER
In an Abaqus/Explicit analysis, include this parameter without any assignment if the surface
interaction model is to be deﬁned in user subroutine VUINTER. Set USER=INTERACTION if the

Required, mutually exclusive parameters:
PERIODIC
Use this parameter to indicate that a periodic three-dimensional model must be generated by revolving
a single three-dimensional sector of the model about the symmetry axis (see Figure 1).

has a constant angle.

a variable angle in the circumferential direction.
In both cases each sector always has the same geometry and mesh. The surfaces on both sides of
the original sector must be completely planar when PERIODIC=VARIABLE. If the surface meshes
on either side of the original sector are not matched completely, constraints between the neighboring
pairs of corresponding surfaces speciﬁed on the data lines will be applied with an automatically

the numbering on the reﬂected part. The default and minimum value is the largest node number
used in the original model.

Set this parameter equal to the distance to be used in the search for duplicate nodes. Duplicate nodes

Optional parameters for using the data line format:
AMPLITUDE
Set this parameter equal to the name of the amplitude curve that gives the time variation of the
temperature throughout the step (see Amplitude Curves).
If this parameter is omitted in an Abaqus/Standard analysis, the reference magnitude is applied
immediately at the beginning of the step or linearly over the step, depending on the value assigned
to the AMPLITUDE parameter on the *STEP option (see Deﬁning an Analysis). If this parameter
is omitted in an Abaqus/Explicit analysis, a linear interpolation is done over the step.
INPUT
Set this parameter equal to the name of the alternate input ﬁle containing the data lines for this
option. See Input Syntax Rules for the syntax of such ﬁle names. If this parameter is omitted, it is
assumed that the data follow the keyword line.
OP
Set OP=MOD (default) for existing *TEMPERATURE values to remain, with this option modifying
existing temperatures or deﬁning additional temperatures.
Set OP=NEW if all existing *TEMPERATURE values should be removed. New temperatures can
be deﬁned.
For a general analysis step, a temperature that is removed via OP=NEW is reset to the value given
on the *INITIAL CONDITIONS option or to zero if no initial temperature was deﬁned. For a linear
perturbation step, a temperature that is removed via OP=NEW is always reset to zero. If temperatures
are being returned to their initial condition values, the AMPLITUDE parameter described above
does not apply. Rather, the AMPLITUDE parameter given on the *STEP option governs the behavior
in an Abaqus/Standard analysis, and the temperatures are always ramped back to their initial
conditions in Abaqus/Explicit analyses. If temperatures are being reset to new values (not to initial
conditions) via OP=NEW, the AMPLITUDE parameter described above applies.
SECTION SPECIFICATION
Set SECTION SPECIFICATION=UNIFORM to deﬁne uniform temperature values.

*TEMPERATURE

Required parameter for reading temperatures from the results or output database file:
FILE
Set this parameter equal to the name of the results or output database ﬁle from which the data are
read. The ﬁle extension is optional; however, if both .fil and .odb ﬁles exist, the results ﬁle will
be used if the INTERPOLATE parameter is omitted. If the INTERPOLATE parameter is used, an
output database ﬁle must exist. See Input Syntax Rules for the syntax of such ﬁle names. This
parameter cannot be used in a *STATIC, RIKS analysis step.
Optional parameters for reading temperatures from the results or output database file:
ABSOLUTE EXTERIOR TOLERANCE
This parameter is relevant only for use with the INTERPOLATE parameter. Set this parameter equal
to the absolute value (given in the units used in the model) by which nodes of the current model
may lie outside the region of the model in the output database speciﬁed by the FILE parameter. If
this parameter is not used or has a value of 0.0, the EXTERIOR TOLERANCE parameter will apply.
EXTERIOR TOLERANCE
This parameter is relevant only for use with the INTERPOLATE parameter. Set this parameter equal
to the fraction of the average element size by which nodes of the current model may lie outside the
region of the elements of the model in the output database speciﬁed by the FILE parameter. The
default value is 0.05.
If both tolerance parameters are speciﬁed, Abaqus uses the tighter tolerance.
BSTEP
Set this parameter equal to the step number (of the analysis whose results or output database ﬁle is
being used as input to this option) that begins the history data to be read. If no value is supplied,
Abaqus will begin reading temperature data from the ﬁrst step available on the ﬁle read.
BINC
Set this parameter equal to the increment number (of the analysis whose results or output database
ﬁle is being used as input to this option) that begins the history data to be read. If no value is supplied,
Abaqus will begin reading temperature data from the ﬁrst increment available (excluding any zero
increments if the results ﬁle was written in Abaqus/Standard using *FILE FORMAT, ZERO
INCREMENT) for step BSTEP on the results or output database ﬁle.
ESTEP
Set this parameter equal to the step number (of the analysis whose results or output database ﬁle is
being used as input to this option) that ends the history data to be read. If no value is supplied,
ESTEP is taken as equal to BSTEP.
EINC
Set this parameter equal to the increment number (of the analysis whose results or output database
ﬁle is being used as input to this option) that ends the history data to be read. If no value is supplied,
EINC is taken as the last available increment of step ESTEP on the ﬁle read.

Set this parameter equal to the starting time (measured relative to the total step time period) after
which the temperatures read from the results ﬁle will be ramped to their initial condition values.
The default value is 
, in which case no temperature ramping takes place. This feature is used to
create a cyclic temperature history from a prior heat transfer analysis that is not cyclic.

mapping ambiguity in cases where element regions in the previous analysis are close or touching.
To accomplish part instance to part instance mapping, deﬁne your element and node sets to correspond
to the respective instances in the previous and current analysis.
INTERPOLATE
Include this parameter to indicate that the temperature ﬁeld needs to be interpolated between
dissimilar meshes. This feature is used to read temperatures from an output database ﬁle generated
during a heat transfer analysis or generated during a global model analysis used with the submodeling
capability. This parameter and the MIDSIDE parameter are mutually exclusive. If the heat transfer
analysis uses ﬁrst-order elements and the current mesh is the same but uses second-order elements,
use the MIDSIDE parameter instead.
MIDSIDE
Include this parameter to indicate that midside node temperatures in second-order elements are to
be interpolated from corner node temperatures. This feature is used to read temperatures from a
results or an output database ﬁle generated during a heat transfer analysis using ﬁrst-order elements.
This parameter and the INTERPOLATE parameter are mutually exclusive.
Required parameter for defining data in user subroutine UTEMP or VUTEMP:
USER
Include this parameter to indicate that user subroutine UTEMP or VUTEMP will be used to deﬁne
temperature values. In an Abaqus/Standard analysis UTEMP is called for each node given on the
data lines. In an Abaqus/Explicit analysis VUTEMP is called for a block of nodes speciﬁed on the
data lines.
If you also specify values on the data lines, these values are ignored. If you specify a results or an
output database ﬁle in addition to user subroutine UTEMP in Abaqus/Standard, values read from
this ﬁle will be passed into UTEMP for possible modiﬁcation. In Abaqus/Explicit user subroutine
VUTEMP cannot be used with a results or output database ﬁle.
Data lines to define gradients of temperature in beams and shells:
First line:
1. Node set or node number.
2. Reference temperature value. If the AMPLITUDE parameter is present, this value and subsequent

Subsequent lines (only needed if there are more than seven temperature points in the element):

2. Etc., up to eight temperatures per line.
If more than seven temperature values are needed at any node, continue on the next line. It may be necessary to
leave blank data lines for some nodes if any other node in the model has more than seven temperature points
because the total number of temperatures that Abaqus expects to read for any node is based on the maximum
number of temperature values of all the nodes in the model. These trailing initial values will be zero and will
not be used in the analysis.
Repeat this set of data lines as often as necessary to define temperatures at different nodes or node
sets.
Data lines to define temperatures for solid or frame elements using the data line format:
First line:
1. Node set or node number.

Repeat this data line as often as necessary to prescribe temperature at different nodes or node sets.
Data lines to define uniform temperature (SECTION SPECIFICATION=UNIFORM):
First line:
1. Node set, node number, or blank.
2. Uniform temperature value.
Repeat this data line as often as necessary to define uniform temperatures at various nodes and node
sets. If you omit both node numbers and node sets (that is, enter a blank space), the specified uniform
temperature is applied to all nodes in the model.
No data lines are needed if temperatures are read from an Abaqus results or output database
file (except when the DRIVING ELSETS parameter is present) and for Abaqus/Standard a user
subroutine is not used (FILE parameter included, USER parameter omitted)

Optional, mutually exclusive parameters:
POSITION TOLERANCE
Set this parameter equal to a cutoff distance that is used to determine which nodes on the secondary
surface are tied to the main surface. The calculation of the distance between the secondary and main
surface for a particular secondary node depends on factors such as shell element thickness, the

satisfy the position tolerance are not tied to the main surface. The default value for this tolerance
distance depends on the type of formulation and surfaces used in the constraints.

surface that will be tied to the main surface. Nodes not included in this node set will not be tied.

Optional parameters:
DT
Set this parameter equal to the desired element stable time increment for the element set provided.
The mass scaling is applied according to the method speciﬁed with the TYPE parameter. If the DT
parameter is omitted, all variable mass scaling deﬁnitions from previous steps are removed, and the
scaled mass matrix from the end of the previous step is carried over to the current step.
ELSET
Set this parameter equal to the name of the element set for which this mass scaling deﬁnition is
being applied. If this parameter is omitted, the mass scaling deﬁnition will apply to all elements in

The *VARIABLE MASS SCALING option can be repeated with different ELSET deﬁnitions to deﬁne
different mass scaling for the speciﬁed element sets.
TYPE
Set TYPE=UNIFORM to scale the masses of the elements equally so that the smallest element
stable time increment of the scaled elements equals the value assigned to DT.
Set TYPE=BELOW MIN (default) to scale the masses of only the elements whose element stable
time increments are less than the value assigned to DT. The masses of these elements will be scaled
so that the element stable time increments equal the value assigned to DT.
Set TYPE=SET EQUAL DT to scale the masses of all elements so that they have the same element
stable time increment equal to the value assigned to DT.
Set TYPE=ROLLING to scale the element masses automatically for the simulation of a rolling

several parameters of the rolling process. The DT parameter will be ignored in this case.
Required, mutually exclusive parameters if the DT parameter or the TYPE=ROLLING parameter

FREQUENCY
Set this parameter equal to the frequency, in increments, at which mass scaling calculations are to

Type:  History data
Level:  Step

References:
• Quasi-Static Analysis
• Rate-Dependent Plasticity: Creep and Swelling
Optional parameters:
ALLSDTOL
Include this parameter to indicate that an adaptive automatic damping algorithm will be activated
in this step. Set this parameter equal to the maximum allowable ratio of the stabilization energy to
the total strain energy. The initial damping factor is speciﬁed via the STABILIZE parameter or the
FACTOR parameter. This damping factor will then be adjusted through the step based on the
convergence history and the value of ALLSDTOL. If this parameter is set equal to zero, the adaptive
automatic damping algorithm is not activated; a constant damping factor will be used throughout
the step. If this parameter is included without a speciﬁed value, the default value is 0.05. If this
parameter is omitted but the STABILIZE parameter is included with the default value of dissipated
energy fraction, the adaptive automatic damping algorithm will be activated automatically with
ALLSDTOL=0.05.
This parameter must be used in conjunction with the STABILIZE parameter (see Solving Nonlinear
Problems).
CETOL
Set this parameter equal to the maximum difference in the creep strain increment calculated from
the creep strain rates based on conditions at the beginning and on conditions at the end of the
increment, thus controlling the accuracy of the creep integration. In general, the tolerance can be
calculated by choosing an acceptable stress error tolerance and dividing by a typical elastic modulus.
If the model consists of a linear viscoelastic material characterized by the *VISCOELASTIC option,
a looser tolerance of the order of the elastic strains can be used. If CETOL is omitted, ﬁxed time
increments are used.
CONTINUE
Set CONTINUE=NO (default) to specify that this step will not carry over the damping factors from
the results of the preceding general step. In this case the initial damping factors will be recalculated
based on the declared damping intensity and on the solution of the ﬁrst increment of the step or can
be speciﬁed directly.
Set CONTINUE=YES to specify that this step will carry over the damping factors from the end of
the immediately preceding general step.
This parameter must be used in conjunction with the ALLSDTOL and the STABILIZE parameters.
1337
*VISCO

CREEP
Set CREEP=EXPLICIT to use explicit integration for creep behavior throughout the step, which
may sometimes be computationally less expensive. The time increment will be limited by the
accuracy tolerance (CETOL) and by the stability limit of the forward difference operator. See
Rate-Dependent Plasticity: Creep and Swelling for details on the integration scheme.
FACTOR
Set this parameter equal to the damping factor to be used in the automatic damping algorithm (see
Solving Nonlinear Problems) if the problem is expected to be unstable due to local instabilities and
the damping factor calculated by Abaqus/Standard is not suitable. This parameter must be used in
conjunction with the STABILIZE parameter and overrides the automatic calculation of the damping
factor based on a value of the dissipated energy fraction.
STABILIZE
Include this parameter to use automatic stabilization if the problem is expected to be unstable due
to local instabilities. Set this parameter equal to the dissipated energy fraction of the automatic
damping algorithm (see Solving Nonlinear Problems). If this parameter is omitted, the stabilization
algorithm is not activated. If this parameter is included without a speciﬁed value, the default value
of the dissipated energy fraction is 2 × 10−4 and the adaptive automatic damping algorithm will be
activated by default with ALLSDTOL=0.05 in this step; set ALLSDTOL=0 to deactivate the adaptive
automatic damping algorithm. If the FACTOR parameter is used, any value of the dissipated energy
fraction will be overridden by the damping factor.
Data line for a transient, quasi-static analysis:
First (and only) line:
1. Suggested initial time increment. This value should be reasonably correct (in agreement with
the strain change allowed with the CETOL parameter) but may be reduced if automatic time
incrementation is being used.
2. Time period of the step.
3. Minimum time increment allowed. If Abaqus/Standard ﬁnds it needs a smaller time increment
than this value, the analysis is terminated. If this entry is zero, a default value of the smaller of
the suggested initial time increment or 10−5 times the total time period is assumed.
4. Maximum time increment allowed. Only used for automatic time incrementation. If this value
is not speciﬁed, no upper limit is imposed.

*VISCOELASTIC: Specify dissipative behavior for use with elasticity.
This option is used to generalize a material's elastic response to include viscoelasticity. The viscoelasticity can

*VISCOELASTIC

This parameter can be used only when the NONLINEAR parameter is included.
Set this parameter equal to the number of ﬁeld variable dependencies included in the deﬁnition of
the creep constants in addition to temperature. If this parameter is omitted, it is assumed that the
creep constants have no dependencies or depend only on temperature. See Specifying Field Variable
Dependence for more information.
PRELOAD
This parameter applies only to Abaqus/Standard analyses.
This parameter can be used only in conjunction with FREQUENCY=TABULAR to specify the
nature of preload used for deﬁning frequency-domain viscoelastic material properties or effective
thickness-direction gasket properties.
Set PRELOAD=UNIAXIAL to specify that the frequency-domain viscoelastic material properties
correspond to a uniaxial test.
Set PRELOAD=VOLUMETRIC to specify that the frequency-domain viscoelastic material properties
correspond to a volumetric test. This setting is not meaningful when used with gasket elements to
deﬁne effective thickness-direction properties.
PROPERTIES
This parameter applies only to Abaqus/Standard analyses and can be used only when LAW=USER
is used.
Set this parameter equal to the number of property values needed as data in user subroutine
UCREEPNETWORK or user subroutine VUCREEPNETWORK. The default is PROPERTIES=0.
TYPE
This parameter cannot be used in conjunction with the NONLINEAR parameter.
Use this parameter to deﬁne whether the *VISCOELASTIC option is being used to deﬁne continuum
material properties or effective thickness-direction gasket properties.
Set TYPE=ISOTROPIC (default, and only option for Abaqus/Explicit) to deﬁne continuum material
properties. This choice is appropriate when the viscoelastic material model is used for any continuum,
structural, or special-purpose elements whose material response is modeled using continuum material
properties (examples of such special-purpose elements include modeling cohesive elements with a
continuum response—see Modeling of an Adhesive Layer of Finite Thickness or gasket elements
with a material response—see Deﬁning the Gasket Behavior Using a Material Model). In
Abaqus/Explicit this parameter should also be used for the deﬁnition of viscoelastic properties for
cohesive elements with elastic traction-separation behavior (Modeling Viscoelastic
Traction-Separation Behavior in Abaqus/Explicit).
Set TYPE=TRANSVERSELY ISOTROPIC to deﬁne a linear, transversely isotropic, viscoelastic
material. This option can be used only with TIME=PRONY or FREQUENCY=PRONY.
Set TYPE=ORTHOTROPIC to deﬁne a linear,orthotropic, viscoelastic material. This option can
be used only with TIME=PRONY or FREQUENCY=PRONY.
Set TYPE=TRACTION to deﬁne effective thickness-direction gasket properties. This option is
supported only for gasket elements whose behavior is modeled directly using a gasket behavior
model (Deﬁning the Gasket Behavior Using a Material Model).

Hyperelastic material model
For hyperelastic materials, you can use the *VOLUMETRIC TEST DATA option to provide volumetric loading
test data that includes user-deﬁned material compressibility. Alternatively, you can include compressibility by:
•
using the POISSON parameter on the *HYPERELASTIC option, or
•
in the case of the Marlow and Valanis-Landel models, by specifying the nominal lateral strain under the
*UNIAXIAL TEST DATA option.
If none of these options is used to specify volumetric behavior, Abaqus/Standard assumes that the material is
incompressible, while Abaqus/Explicit selects a default value for the compressibility.
See the discussion in Compressibility before using this option in Abaqus/Explicit.
Optional parameters:
SMOOTH
Include this parameter to apply a smoothing ﬁlter to the stress-strain data. If the parameter is omitted,
no smoothing is performed.
