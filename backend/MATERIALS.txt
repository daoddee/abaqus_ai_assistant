Abaqus Materials Guide
The Abaqus Materials Guide describes the Abaqus material modeling options and how to calibrate some of the more
advanced material models.
This guide is a part of the Abaqus
® documentation collection, which describes all the capabilities of the Abaqus ﬁnite
element analysis technology used in SIMULIA
® applications.
Materials are deﬁned by selecting material behaviors and deﬁning them and combining complementary material
behaviors such as elasticity and plasticity. A local coordinate system can be used for material calculations. Any
anisotropic properties must be given in this local system.
The material library in Abaqus is intended to provide comprehensive coverage of both linear and nonlinear, isotropic
and anisotropic material behaviors. The use of numerical integration in the elements, including numerical integration
across the cross-sections of shells and beams, provides the ﬂexibility to analyze the most complex composite structures.
Material behaviors fall into the following general categories:
•
general properties (material damping, density, thermal expansion);
•
elastic mechanical properties;
•
inelastic mechanical properties;
•
multiscale properties;
•
thermal properties;
•
acoustic properties;
•
hydrostatic ﬂuid properties;
•
equations of state;
•
mass diffusion properties;
•
electrical properties; and
•
pore ﬂuid ﬂow properties.
Some of the mechanical behaviors offered are mutually exclusive: such behaviors cannot appear together in a single
material deﬁnition. Some behaviors require the presence of other behaviors; for example, plasticity requires linear
elasticity. Such requirements are discussed at the end of each material behavior description, as well as in Combining
Material Behaviors.

What's New
This page describes recent changes in Abaqus Materials.
2025 FD01
PRX-Fatigue Criterion
You can use the PRX-Fatigue criterion to model delamination propagation under cyclic loading in
Abaqus/Standard.
Beneﬁts: The PRX-Fatigue criterion offers smoother delamination fronts and faster solution times due to its
better convergence characteristics.
The Progressive Release eXplicit Virtual Crack Closure Technique (PRX-VCCT) criterion has been extended
to support delamination propagation under cyclic fatigue loading. PRX-Fatigue is available only in
Abaqus/Standard. Similar to the PRX-VCCT criterion, it incorporates a progressive nodal release strategy within
a conventional VCCT framework as well as an "explicit" computation of the delamination increment based on
energy release rates of the previous increment.
The following ﬁgures show results from a linear elastic fatigue crack growth simulation in a single leg bend
specimen, where the fracture energy release rates are computed using either the traditional-VCCT technique
(top) or the PRX-VCCT technique (bottom). The results obtained by using the two different approaches agree
very well with one another.

What's New

For more information, see Crack Propagation Analysis, Fatigue Crack Growth Laws for Linear Elastic Materials,
*FRACTURE CRITERION, and Debonding behavior of a single leg bending specimen.
Hencky Hyperelastic Model in Abaqus/Explicit
You can now use the Hencky hyperelastic model to deﬁne hyperelastic material response in Abaqus/Explicit.
Beneﬁts: This enhancement extends the functionality of Abaqus/Explicit.
The Hencky hyperelasticity model was ﬁrst introduced in Abaqus/Standard in 2024 FD02 (see Hencky Hyperelastic
Model in Abaqus/Standard). The model is now supported in Abaqus/Explicit, including results transfer between
Abaqus/Standard and Abaqus/Explicit.
For more information, see Hyperelastic Behavior of Rubberlike Materials.
Paperboard Material Model
You can now model paperboard material in Abaqus/Explicit and Abaqus/Standard.
Beneﬁts: You can now simulate workﬂows in industries that use paperboard material widely, such as in the
packaging industry.
A paperboard material is highly orthotropic with local directions as shown below.
11
Abaqus Materials Guide
What's New

The in-plane behavior and the out-of-plane behavior can be considered to be decoupled. The out-of-plane behavior
includes both the compression in the thickness direction and the out-of-plane shear. Plastic behavior is modeled
both in the in-plane model and the out-of-plane model.
The image below shows the plastic strain results of the analysis modeling the creasing of paperboard.
For more information, see Paperboard Material Model.
2024 FD03
Piezoresistive Effect
You can now model materials exhibiting piezoresistive behavior in Abaqus/Standard.
Beneﬁts: You can now analyze and design piezoresistive sensors such as silicon piezoresistive pressure sensors.
A piezoresistive material changes its electrical resistivity when stressed. This coupling between stress and
electrical resistivity is the material's piezoresistivity property. Silicon piezoresistive sensors have been widely
used in the ﬁeld of microelectromechanical systems. The ﬁgure below shows the simulated results between
pressure and voltage output of a silicon piezoresistive pressure sensor.

Electrical Resistivity
You can now deﬁne electrical resistivity directly in Abaqus/Standard.
Beneﬁts: This provides an easier and more robust way to deﬁne electrical resistivity.
In earlier releases, you could deﬁne only electrical conductivity in coupled thermal-electrical elements and
coupled thermal-electrical-structural elements. Calculating electrical resistivity from electrical conductivity
requires an inversion and might introduce complications for temperature/ﬁeld variable-dependent properties.
Now you can deﬁne electrical resistivity directly. Electrical properties must be deﬁned in terms of resistivity
for materials with piezoresistive behavior.
For more information, see Electrical Resistivity.
Modified Darveaux Viscous Behavior for Parallel Rheological Framework
You can now use the modiﬁed Darveaux model to deﬁne creep response in the parallel rheological framework
(PRF).
Beneﬁts: The modiﬁed Darveaux model provides more accurate results when the step contains idle time or
periods of zero loading.
The Darveaux creep law previously available with the PRF material model introduces an explicit dependency
of creep strain rate on total time, which can lead to unexpected results when the load is not applied at time zero.
In the modiﬁed Darveaux model, the creep evolution law is revised by eliminating total time and using the
accumulated total steady-state creep strain instead. This approach provides a solution that does not depend on
the loading sequence when the step time has an idle or no-load period. Both models provide the same response
under constant load and temperature applied at time zero.
To illustrate the difference between the original and modiﬁed Darveaux creep law, the following example
considers uniaxial loading of a specimen ﬁxed at one end and with a load applied at the other end. The load is
ramped up rapidly and then kept constant. Two different loading cases are considered. For BC-1, the load is
applied instantaneously at the ﬁrst increment; for BC-2, the load is applied after some time with no loading. In
both cases, the load is kept constant for the same amount of time. The results are compared below for both the

original and modiﬁed Darveaux laws. For easier comparison, the results obtained from BC-2 are superimposed
on BC-1 after shifting the time axis by the initial period with no load.

The ﬁgure illustrates that when the load is applied at the very ﬁrst increment (BC-1), both the original and
modiﬁed Darveaux models produce the same time history of equivalent creep strain. However, the original
Darveaux model displays a different evolution of equivalent creep strain when the load is applied after a certain
amount of time (BC-2). By contrast, the modiﬁed Darveaux model produces the same equivalent creep strain
for both BC-1 and BC-2. This behavior is the expected result because both BC-1 and BC-2 have the same physical
loading time.

Unsymmetric Solution Scheme for the Superelastic Model
Abaqus/Standard now automatically activates the unsymmetric solution scheme for the superelastic material
model if you use the nonassociated ﬂow rule.
Beneﬁts: This capability improves convergence of the superelastic model with the nonassociated ﬂow rule.
For more information, see Superelasticity.
Tangent Thermal Expansion
You can now deﬁne thermal expansion effects by specifying tangent thermal expansion coefﬁcients.
Beneﬁts: This capability provides ﬂexibility in deﬁning thermal expansion effects and eliminates the need to
convert tangent thermal expansion coefﬁcients when tangent coefﬁcients are available.
In earlier releases, Abaqus/Standard required that the thermal expansion coefﬁcients be deﬁned in secant (or
total) form. The total form is generally recommended because it leads to thermal strain results that are not
dependent on the temperature and ﬁeld variable history or sensitive to the time increment size. However, when
a material undergoes an irreversible transformation (such as during the curing process of polymers), the evolution
of thermal strains is better characterized in terms of tangent (or differential) expansion coefﬁcients that are a
function of the degree of transformation. In these cases, it is generally not possible to convert the tangent form
to an equivalent secant form of thermal expansion, and the only solution was to use user subroutine UEXPAN.
Now you can deﬁne thermal expansion behavior directly in tangent form in Abaqus/Standard. As in the case of
secant thermal expansion, the tangent thermal expansion can be isotropic, transversely isotropic, orthotropic,
and fully anisotropic.
Both the secant and the tangent methods produce identical results if the coefﬁcients are constant. If the expansion
coefﬁcients depend only on temperature, the conversion from tangent to secant form is always possible; therefore,
we recommend that you use the secant form to eliminate the sensitivity of thermal strain results on time increment
size. However, in situations when the coefﬁcients depend on ﬁeld variables, the two methods are not equivalent
Abaqus Materials Guide
14
What's New

in general, and it is not possible to perform the conversion. For these situations you can now use the tangent
deﬁnition.
To illustrate the beneﬁts of the new functionality, consider an example of resin curing. During the curing process,
the resin material undergoes two transformations. The ﬁrst one is a transformation from a liquid to a solid phase,
known as gelation. At this point, the material is in a rubbery state. As the glass transition temperature, Tg,
increases and eventually exceeds the temperature of the curing process, the material transforms from the rubbery
state to the glassy state. Assume that the tangent thermal expansion coefﬁcients for the liquid, rubbery, and glass
phases are given by  l,  r, and  g, respectively. Using a value of degree of cure (DOC) of 0.5 as a measure of the
gelation transformation from liquid to rubbery state, we can express the tangent thermal expansion coefﬁcient
as:
•
  =  l if DOC   0.5,
•
  =  r if DOC > 0.5 and (Tg-T)   0,
•
  =  g if DOC > 0.5 and (Tg-T) > 0.
You can now use the tangent thermal expansion deﬁnition to deﬁne these thermal expansion coefﬁcients in
tabular form, as functions of two ﬁeld variables associated with the degree of cure (DOC) and the difference
between the glass transition temperature and temperature TGTDIFF=(Tg-T) as shown below (see also Prediction
of cure-induced spring-in of an angle bracket).

Using Low-Density Foam with Eulerian Elements and ALE Analysis
You can now perform a coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian analysis or an analysis involving ALE adaptive meshing
for a model with a low-density foam material.
Beneﬁts: You can complete more effective simulations for analyses that involve extreme deformation or distortion
of the mesh.
For analyses that involve extreme mesh deformation, coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian analyses are more effective
than traditional Lagrangian analyses because the elements do not deform and materials are allowed to ﬂow
through the element faces. For an analysis involving ALE adaptive meshing, allowing the mesh to move
independently of the material enables you to maintain a high-quality mesh throughout an analysis, even when
large deformation or loss of material occurs.

Nonlinear Viscoelastic Shear Behavior for EOS Materials
You can now combine nonlinear viscoelastic shear behavior with equation of state (EOS) materials in
Abaqus/Explicit to model the response of viscoelastic ﬂuids.
15
Abaqus Materials Guide
What's New

Beneﬁts: The new material capability lets you model viscoelastic ﬂuids and improves the stable time increment
when you model ﬂuids with large viscosities.
The family of EOS materials in Abaqus/Explicit now allows you to deﬁne nonlinear viscoelastic shear behavior
based on a Maxwell-type model (that is, elastic and viscous effects acting in series). In earlier releases, you could
deﬁne the deviatoric response of EOS materials using only elastic or viscous shear behavior.
The new functionality also provides an efﬁcient method to model viscous ﬂuids with very high viscosity. As
the viscosity of a ﬂuid increases, it leads to a signiﬁcant reduction in the stable time increment required for an
explicit dynamic simulation. You can use the new nonlinear viscoelastic behavior to approximate a purely viscous
shear response by treating the shear modulus, µ, as a penalty stiffness that you can adjust to achieve a reasonable
stable time increment without signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the overall shear viscous response.
The ﬁgure below shows the history output of shear stress in a simple shear stress relaxation test with the new
material model (dashed line with symbols). The plot compares well with the analytical solution (solid line).

Darveaux Viscous Behavior for Parallel Rheological Framework
You can now use the Darveaux model to deﬁne creep response in the parallel rheological framework.
Beneﬁts: The Darveaux model allows you to consider both primary and secondary creep, which enables more
accurate results.
In earlier releases, the Darveaux creep model was available in Abaqus/Standard to deﬁne creep behavior with
linear elasticity as well as the viscous behavior for a two-layer viscoplastic material. This creep model can be
useful for capturing rate-dependent behavior in certain classes of polymer such as Nylon 12. You can now use
this creep model to deﬁne the viscous behavior in models deﬁned using the parallel rheological framework in
both Abaqus/Standard and Abaqus/Explicit. The model takes into account both primary (transient) and secondary
(steady-state) creep. The secondary creep in the Darveaux model is described by the hyperbolic-sine law, which
is modiﬁed to include the primary creep contribution that occurs immediately after the stress is applied and
before a steady-state creep stage is reached.
Abaqus Materials Guide
16
What's New

To illustrate the difference between the hyperbolic-sine and the Darveaux models, the following example considers
a specimen that is ﬁxed at one end and to which a load is applied at the other end. The load is applied rapidly
and then kept constant. The specimen’s elastic response is modeled using a Hencky hyperelastic material, and
the creep behavior is described either by the Darveaux or by the hyperbolic-sine creep model. The results are
compared below.

The hyperbolic-sine law model predicts a response that shows the constant equivalent creep strain rate, which
often accurately captures the steady-state response at a constant load accurately. The response of the Darveaux
model includes the transient creep effects, where the equivalent creep strain rate increases very quickly, stabilizes
when the steady-state creep stage is reached, and then remains constant (as in the case of the hyperbolic-sine
law).
For more information, see Parallel Rheological Framework.
Hencky Hyperelastic Model in Abaqus/Standard
You can now use the Hencky model to deﬁne hyperelastic material response accurately.
Beneﬁts: You can now accurately predict elastic material response for moderately large deformations.
The Hencky model is an isotropic hyperelastic model that assumes a linear relation between the Kirchhoff stress
tensor and the Hencky or logarithmic strain tensor. It is a generalization of the classical Hooke's law for isotropic
inﬁnitesimal elasticity. You deﬁne the model by providing two material parameters that can be measured at
inﬁnitesimal strains. The Hencky model can produce results that show good agreement with experimental data
for a wide class of materials for moderately large deformations. You can also use the model as a ﬁnite strain
alternative to the isotropic linear elastic model in situations where the isotropic linear elastic model is known to
perform poorly (for example, for materials subjected to cyclic loads). In this case, the isotropic linear elastic
material, which uses a rate formulation, might produce residual stresses when it returns to the initial (stress-free)
conﬁguration. The Hencky model does not show this undesirable behavior because it uses the total deformation
to compute stresses.
Figure 1 shows a specimen subjected to simple shear cycling deformations with the mechanical response modeled
using the Hencky and isotropic linear elastic models. Twenty cycles are performed with a different number of
increments per cycle, and Figure 2 shows the Mises equivalent stresses. The results for the isotropic linear elastic
material accumulate signiﬁcant errors for a small number of increments per cycle, resulting in large residual
stresses after a few cycles. They improve for larger numbers of increments per cycle and stabilize when the
number increases to about 100. In contrast, the Hencky model shows no residual stresses even in the case where
only two increments are used per cycle.

Generalized Damage and Failure for Anisotropic Materials
You can now specify new failure criteria for fully anisotropic materials to evaluate the strength of the material
based on stress or strain results. You can also use the same failure criteria at the pseudo-grain level for multiscale
materials.
Beneﬁts: The new stress/strain-based failure criteria are available with any material type and all
stress/displacement elements, which gives you more options to evaluate the strength of materials.
Abaqus Materials Guide

What's New

Abaqus now provides a collection of stress/strain-based generalized damage initiation criteria as indicators of
material failure. These general stress/strain-based damage initiation criteria are based on Tsai-Wu theory or
maximum stress/strain theory. Abaqus does not support damage evolution laws for these damage criteria.
The ﬁgure below shows the failure index evaluated using the Tsai-Wu failure theory in an open hole tension
test. The coupon plate is modeled with composite solid elements with [45/0/45/90]s layups.

Damage and Failure for Fiber-Reinforced Composites Using Multiscale Modeling
You can now specify new failure criteria for ﬁber-reinforced composite materials to evaluate the strength of the
material based on stress invariants at the micro-level. You can also specify damage evolution laws for these
damage criteria.
Beneﬁts: The new damage initiation criteria allow you to evaluate damage at the composite constituent level
using multiscale modeling, which simpliﬁes damage modeling.
Abaqus/Standard offers capabilities for predicting the onset of damage and for modeling progressive damage
and failure at the constituent level in ﬁber-reinforced composites, which include unidirectional and woven
ﬁber-reinforced composite materials. You can use the criteria with both 2D and 3D solid and shell
stress/displacement elements. You can specify only linear responses in the constituents. You can also use the
new damage initiation criteria in 3D elements; in earlier releases, these criteria were available for plane stress
elements only.

Field Expansion in Pore Fluid in a Porous Medium
You can now use ﬁeld expansion with the pore ﬂuid phase in a porous medium.
Abaqus Materials Guide
20
What's New

Beneﬁts: The ability to deﬁne ﬁeld expansion in the solid and the ﬂuid phases in a porous medium independently
provides a convenient way to introduce expansion of the material due to physical sources other than temperature,
without having to model such sources explicitly.
In earlier releases, you could only deﬁne ﬁeld expansion for the solid grains that make up the skeleton in a porous
medium. Now, you can deﬁne ﬁeld expansion in the different phases in a porous medium; that is, the solid grains
and the pore ﬂuid, independently. You can deﬁne only isotropic ﬁeld expansion behavior for the pore ﬂuid.
In addition, you can also output the strains due to both ﬁeld expansion and thermal expansion in the pore ﬂuid.
For more information, see Thermal Expansion and Field Expansion.
Band-Limited Damping in Abaqus/Standard
You can now specify band-limited damping in Abaqus/Standard.
Beneﬁts: The band-limited damping allows you to specify a damping ratio that remains approximately constant
within a frequency range speciﬁed.
In many solid materials subjected to oscillatory loads, the energy dissipated in a cycle is controlled by internal
friction and is insensitive to the frequency of the oscillation. This behavior cannot be captured by the stiffness
proportional (beta) or mass proportional (alpha) damping options previously available in Abaqus/Standard, but
can be modeled using the band-limited damping option. For this model, you specify the damping ratio, which
can be deﬁned as a function of temperature variables, ﬁeld variables, or both. In addition, you provide the low
and high frequency cutoff values to specify the frequency range, and Abaqus maintains approximately constant
value of the damping ratio (and energy dissipated per cycle) within this range. In Abaqus/Standard, the effect
of band-limited damping is considered only with the implicit dynamic procedure.
Figure 3 shows a bar subjected to harmonic excitations. The bar is ﬁxed at the left end, and a displacement
boundary condition is applied at the other end with different forced frequencies. The bar is modeled using a
linearly elastic material in combination with band-limited damping. A constant damping ratio of 0.02 is speciﬁed,
the low angular frequency is 1, and the high angular frequency is 10. Figure 4 shows the energy dissipated as a
function of angular frequency, which remains approximately constant within the frequency range speciﬁed and
decreases rapidly outside of the range. The damping ratio, obtained by scaling the energy dissipated in a cycle
by the maximum value of the strain energy, is shown in Figure 5 and follows a similar pattern. As expected,
Abaqus achieves a damping ratio approximately equal to 0.02 within the speciﬁed range of frequencies.

Introduction

About the Material Library
Overview
The material library in Abaqus is intended to provide comprehensive coverage of both linear and nonlinear, isotropic
and anisotropic material behaviors.
The use of numerical integration in the elements, including numerical integration across the cross-sections of shells
and beams, provides the ﬂexibility to analyze the most complex composite structures.
This section describes how to deﬁne materials in Abaqus and contains brief descriptions of each of the material behaviors
provided. Further details of the more advanced behaviors are provided in the Abaqus Theory Guide.
References:
Defining Materials
Materials are deﬁned by:
•
selecting material behaviors and deﬁning them (Material Data Deﬁnition); and
•
combining complementary material behaviors such as elasticity and plasticity (Combining Material Behaviors).
A local coordinate system can be used for material calculations (Orientations). Any anisotropic properties must
be given in this local system.
Available Material Behaviors
Material behaviors fall into the following general categories:
•
general properties (material damping, density, thermal expansion);
•
elastic mechanical properties;
•
inelastic mechanical properties;
•
thermal properties;
•
acoustic properties;
•
hydrostatic ﬂuid properties;
•
equations of state;
•
mass diffusion properties;
•
electrical properties; and
•
pore ﬂuid ﬂow properties.
Some of the mechanical behaviors offered are mutually exclusive: such behaviors cannot appear together in a
single material deﬁnition. Some behaviors require the presence of other behaviors; for example, plasticity requires
linear elasticity. Such requirements are discussed at the end of each material behavior description, as well as in
Combining Material Behaviors.

About the Material Library

Using Material Behaviors with Various Element Types
There are no general restrictions on the use of particular material behaviors with solid, shell, beam, and pipe
elements. Any combination that makes sense is acceptable. The few restrictions that do exist are mentioned when
that particular behavior is described in the pages that follow. A section on the elements available for use with a
material behavior appears at the end of each material behavior description.
Using Complete Material Definitions
A material deﬁnition can include behaviors that are not meaningful for the elements or analysis in which the
material is being used. Such behaviors will be ignored. For example, a material deﬁnition can include heat
transfer properties (conductivity, speciﬁc heat) as well as stress-strain properties (elastic moduli, yield stress,
etc). When this material deﬁnition is used with uncoupled stress/displacement elements, the heat transfer properties
are ignored by Abaqus; when it is used with heat transfer elements, the mechanical strength properties are ignored.
This capability allows you to develop complete material deﬁnitions and use them in any analysis.
Defining Spatially Varying Material Behavior for Homogenous Solid Continuum
Elements Using Distributions in Abaqus/Standard
In Abaqus/Standard spatially varying mass density (Density), linear elastic behavior (Linear Elastic Behavior),
and thermal expansion (Thermal Expansion) can be deﬁned for homogeneous solid continuum elements using
distributions (Distribution Deﬁnition). Using distributions in a model with signiﬁcant variation in material
behavior can greatly simplify pre- and postprocessing and improve performance during the analysis by allowing
a single material deﬁnition to deﬁne the spatially varying material behavior. Without distributions such a model
may require many material deﬁnitions and associated section assignments.

can be speciﬁed in a local coordinate system (Orientations), which is required if the material is not isotropic.
Material Definitions
Any number of materials can be deﬁned in an analysis. Each material deﬁnition can contain any number of
material behaviors, as required, to specify the complete material behavior. For example, in a linear static stress
analysis only elastic material behavior might be needed, while in a more complicated analysis several material
behaviors might be required.
A name must be assigned to each material deﬁnition. This name allows the material to be referenced from the
section deﬁnitions used to assign this material to regions in the model.
*MATERIAL, NAME=name
Input File Usage:
Each material deﬁnition is speciﬁed in a data block, which is initiated by a
*MATERIAL option. The material deﬁnition continues until an option that does not
deﬁne a material behavior (such as another *MATERIAL option) is introduced, at
which point the material deﬁnition is assumed to be complete. The order of the
material behavior options is not important. All material behavior options within the
data block are assumed to deﬁne the same material.

Large-Strain Considerations
When giving material properties for ﬁnite-strain calculations, “stress” means “true” (Cauchy) stress (force per
current area) and “strain” means logarithmic strain. For example, unless otherwise indicated, for uniaxial behavior
Specifying Material Data as Functions of Temperature and Independent Field Variables
Material data are often speciﬁed as functions of independent variables such as temperature. Material properties
are made temperature dependent by specifying them at several different temperatures.
In some cases a material property can be deﬁned as a function of variables calculated by Abaqus; for example,
to deﬁne a work-hardening curve, stress must be given as a function of equivalent plastic strain.
Material properties can also depend on “ﬁeld variables” (user-deﬁned variables that can represent any independent
quantity and are deﬁned at the nodes, as functions of time). For example, material moduli can be functions of
weave density in a composite or of phase fraction in an alloy. See Specifying Field Variable Dependence for
details. The initial values of ﬁeld variables are given as initial conditions (see Initial Conditions) and can be
modiﬁed as functions of time during an analysis (see Predeﬁned Fields). This capability is useful if, for example,
material properties change with time because of irradiation or some other precalculated environmental effect.
Any material behaviors deﬁned using a distribution in Abaqus/Standard (mass density, linear elastic behavior,
and thermal expansion) cannot be deﬁned with temperature and/or ﬁeld dependence. However, material behaviors
deﬁned with distributions can be included in a material deﬁnition with other material behaviors that have
temperature and/or ﬁeld dependence. See Density, Linear Elastic Behavior, and Thermal Expansion.
Interpolation of Material Data
In the simplest case of a constant property, only the constant value is entered. When the material data are functions
of only one variable, the data must be given in order of increasing values of the independent variable. Abaqus
then interpolates linearly for values between those given. Thus, you can give as many or as few input values as
are necessary for the material model. If the material data depend on the independent variable in a strongly
nonlinear manner, you must specify enough data points so that a linear interpolation captures the nonlinear
behavior accurately.
When material properties depend on several variables, the variation of the properties with respect to the ﬁrst
variable must be given at ﬁxed values of the other variables, in ascending values of the second variable, then of
the third variable, and so on. The data must always be ordered so that the independent variables are given
increasing values. This process ensures that the value of the material property is completely and uniquely deﬁned
at any values of the independent variables on which the property depends. See Input Syntax Rules for further
explanation and an example.

Material Data Definition

In this case the second independent variable (temperature) must be held constant, while the yield stress is described
as a function of the ﬁrst independent variable (equivalent plastic strain). Then, a higher value of temperature is
chosen and the dependence on equivalent plastic strain is given at this temperature. This process, as shown in
the following table, is repeated as often as necessary to describe the property variations in as much detail as
required:
Temperature
Equivalent Plastic Strain
Yield Stress
Extrapolation of Material Data
By default, the property is assumed to be constant outside the range of independent variables given (except for
fabric materials, where the property is extrapolated linearly outside the speciﬁed range). For some properties,
Abaqus allows you to choose the extrapolation method outside the speciﬁed range. In these cases, you can specify
if the value of the property is constant or is extrapolated linearly outside the range. If the latter method is selected,
Abaqus extrapolates the property linearly using the slope at the last speciﬁed data point.
Example: Extrapolation for Elastic-Plastic Material with Isotropic Hardening
In Table 1 the Mises isotropic yield surface is deﬁned by providing three data points.

The response of the material outside the range of equivalent plastic strain (
) depends on the extrapolation
method speciﬁed, as shown in Figure 3.

Specifying Field Variable Dependence
You can specify the number of user-deﬁned ﬁeld variable dependencies required for many material behaviors
(see Predeﬁned Fields). If you do not specify a number of ﬁeld variable dependencies for a material behavior
with which ﬁeld variable dependence is available, the material data are assumed not to depend on ﬁeld variables.
*MATERIAL BEHAVIOR OPTION, DEPENDENCIES=n
Input File Usage:
*MATERIAL BEHAVIOR OPTION refers to any material behavior option for which
ﬁeld dependence can be speciﬁed. Each data line can hold up to eight data items. If
more ﬁeld variable dependencies are required than ﬁt on a single data line, more
data lines can be added. For example, a linear, isotropic elastic material can be deﬁned
as a function of temperature and seven ﬁeld variables (

Material Data Definition

material behavior refers to any material behavior for which ﬁeld dependence can
be speciﬁed.
Specifying Material Data as Functions of Solution-Dependent Variables
In Abaqus you can introduce dependence on solution variables through a user subroutine or by direct speciﬁcation.
User Subroutine Approach
User subroutines USDFLD in Abaqus/Standard and VUSDFLD in Abaqus/Explicit allow you to deﬁne ﬁeld
variables at a material point as functions of time, material directions, and any of the available material point
quantities. These quantities are listed in Abaqus/Standard Output Variable Identiﬁers for USDFLD and in
Available Output Variable Keys for VUSDFLD. Material properties deﬁned as functions of these ﬁeld variables,
therefore, can depend on the solution.
User subroutines USDFLD and VUSDFLD are called at each material point for which the material deﬁnition
includes a reference to the user subroutine.
For general analysis steps the values of variables provided in user subroutines USDFLD and VUSDFLD are
those corresponding to the start of the increment. Hence, the solution dependence introduced in this way is
explicit; the material properties for a given increment are not inﬂuenced by the results obtained during the
increment. Consequently, the accuracy of the results generally depends on the time increment size. This is not
typically a concern in Abaqus/Explicit because the stable time increment is usually sufﬁciently small to ensure
good accuracy. In Abaqus/Standard you can control the time increment from inside user subroutine USDFLD.
For linear perturbation steps the solution variables in the base state are available. For a discussion of general and
linear perturbation steps, see General and Perturbation Procedures.
*USER DEFINED FIELD, TYPE=USER (default)
Input File Usage:
User subroutines USDFLD and VUSDFLD are not supported in Abaqus/CAE.
Abaqus/CAE Usage:
Direct Specification Approach
There are applications where it is desirable to redeﬁne a ﬁeld variable to be equal to the value of a scalar output
variable. In such cases, you can avoid the overhead of writing and maintaining a user subroutine and, instead,
introduce solution dependence directly by associating a ﬁeld variable with an existing scalar output variable in
Abaqus. For scalar output variables, you only need to specify the output variable identiﬁer to build this association.
However, for a vector or a tensor output variable, you must specify the appropriate component of the variable
(for example, specify PE11 instead of PE to associate a ﬁeld variable with the -11- component of the plastic
strain tensor).
Any output variable that is available with the GETVRM or the VGETVRM utility routine, used to access material
point information in Abaqus/Standard and Abaqus/Explicit, respectively, can be associated with a ﬁeld variable.
For general analysis steps the values of the output variables are those corresponding to the start of the increment.
Hence, the solution dependence introduced in this way is explicit; the material properties for a given increment
are not inﬂuenced by the results obtained during the increment. Consequently, the accuracy of the results typically
depends on the time increment size. This is usually not a concern in Abaqus/Explicit because the stable time
increment is usually sufﬁciently small to ensure good accuracy. For linear perturbation steps the output variables
in the base state are used. For a discussion of general and linear perturbation steps, see General and Perturbation
Procedures.

Abaqus/CAE Usage:
Material Failure and Element Deletion
Abaqus offers a general framework for material failure modeling that allows the combination of multiple failure
mechanisms acting simultaneously on the same material. Material failure refers to the complete loss of
load-carrying capacity at a material point that results from progressive degradation of the material stiffness or
instantaneous rupture based on material constitutive models or by user speciﬁcation. An active material point
is considered to turn inactive (deleted) on material failure. For material behaviors deﬁned by user subroutines,
you can control the status of a material point inside user subroutines using solution-dependent state variables
(see Deleting Elements from a Mesh Using State Variables). In Abaqus/Explicit output variable STATUSMP
can be used to request the status at each material point. This variable is equal to one if the material point is active
and equal to zero if the material point fails.
Unless speciﬁed otherwise for particular material behaviors, an element is deleted (or removed) from a mesh on
material failure. Detailed criteria for element deletion driven by material failure in Abaqus/Standard and
Abaqus/Explicit are described below. Deleted elements have no ability to carry stresses and, therefore, do not
contribute to the stiffness of the model. In a heat transfer analysis the thermal contribution of the element is also
removed when the element deletion criterion is reached.
The status of an element can be determined by requesting output variable STATUS. This variable is equal to
one if the element is active and equal to zero if the element is deleted. Elements that have been removed are not
displayed when you view the deformed model in the Visualization module of Abaqus/CAE (Abaqus/Viewer).
However, the elements still remain in the Abaqus model. You can choose to display removed elements by
suppressing the use of the STATUS variable (see Selecting the status ﬁeld output variable).
Alternatively, several material failure mechanisms allow you to retain fully damaged elements (along with a
residual stiffness) in the computations even after material failure. For example, for progressive damage and
failure modeling, you can specify the value of the maximum degradation and whether element deletion occurs
when the degradation reaches this value (see Controlling Element Deletion and Maximum Degradation for
Materials with Damage Evolution).
Element Deletion Driven by Material Failure in Abaqus/Standard
In Abaqus/Standard an element is removed from the mesh if the material fails at all the section points at all the
integration locations of the element. In addition, for cohesive elements with traction-separation response, elements
are deleted only if none of the integration points are in compression.
Element Deletion Driven by Material Failure in Abaqus/Explicit
In Abaqus/Explicit a general rule for element deletion from the mesh is that the material fails at all of the section
points at any one integration location of an element. It is not necessary for all material points in the element to
fail. The following examples describe default behavior that results in element removal:
•
Solid elements: material failure at any one integration point.
•
Second-order reduced-integration beam elements: material failure at all section points through the thickness
at either of the two element integration locations along the beam axis.
•
Modiﬁed triangular and tetrahedral solid elements and fully integrated membrane elements: material failure
at any one integration point.
Abaqus Materials Guide
32
Material Data Definition

The general rule has two exceptions. First, the criterion for element deletion for cohesive elements is that the
material fails at all integration points. In addition, for cohesive elements with traction-separation response,
elements are deleted only if none of the integration points are in compression.
Second, a shell element is removed from the mesh by default when all of the active section points (that is, section
points where the material has not failed) at any one integration location share the same through-the-thickness
z-location. In this condition, the shell element cannot sustain any bending moment. Speciﬁcally, a shell element
is deleted when any one integration location has at most one active section point or at least two active section
points and all of them share the same z-location. For example, in the case of a two-layer composite with three
section points per layer, the third section point of the ﬁrst layer and the ﬁrst point of the second layer share the
same z-location (on the interface between the two layers). The element deletion criterion is triggered if only one
of the six section points is left active or if only the two points mentioned above (that share the same z-location)
remain active.
Difficulties Associated with Element Removal in Abaqus/Standard
When elements are removed from the model, their nodes still remain in the model even if they are not attached
to any active elements. When the solution progresses, these nodes can undergo nonphysical displacements due
to the extrapolation scheme used in Abaqus/Standard to speed up the solution (see Convergence Criteria for
Nonlinear Problems). You can prevent these nonphysical displacements by turning off the extrapolation. In
addition, applying a point load to a node that is not attached to an active element causes convergence difﬁculties
since there is no stiffness to resist the load. You should take precautions to avoid these situations.
Defining the Characteristic Element Length at a Material Point in Abaqus/Explicit
The characteristic element length is used by Abaqus for the regularization of models that exhibit strain softening
or is passed to user subroutines that are called at a material point. By default, Abaqus computes the characteristic
element length using the geometric mean–based deﬁnition.
The default value for a ﬁrst-order element is the typical length of a line across an element, and the default value
for a second-order element is half of the same typical length. For trusses the default value is a characteristic
length along the element axis. For membranes and shells the default value is a characteristic length in the reference
surface. For axisymmetric elements the default value is a characteristic length in the r–z plane only.
In Abaqus/Explicit you can redeﬁne the value of the characteristic element length based on the element topology
and geometry in user subroutine VUCHARLENGTH.
Use the following option for the geometric mean–based deﬁnition of the characteristic
element length (default):
Input File Usage:
*CHARACTERISTIC LENGTH, DEFINITION=GEOMETRIC MEAN

Regularizing User-Defined Data in Abaqus/Explicit
Interpolating material data as functions of independent variables requires table lookups of the material data
values during the analysis. The table lookups occur frequently in Abaqus/Explicit and are most economical if
33
Abaqus Materials Guide
Material Data Definition

the interpolation is from regular intervals of the independent variables. For example, the data shown in Figure
1 are not regular because the intervals in temperature (the independent variable) between adjacent data points
vary. You are not required to specify regular material data. Abaqus/Explicit automatically regularizes user-deﬁned
data. For example, the temperature values in Figure 1 can be deﬁned at 10°, 20°, 25°, 28°, 30°, and 35° C. In
this case Abaqus/Explicit can regularize the data by deﬁning the data over 25 increments of 1° C and your
piecewise linear data will be reproduced exactly. This regularization requires the expansion of your data from
values at 6 temperature points to values at 26 temperature points. This example is a case where a simple
regularization can reproduce your data exactly.
If there are multiple independent variables, the concept of regular data also requires that the minimum and
maximum values (the range) be constant for each independent variable while specifying the other independent
variables. The material deﬁnition in Figure 2 illustrates a case where the material data are not regular since
, 
, and 
. Abaqus/Explicit will also regularize data involving multiple independent
variables, although the data provided must satisfy the rules speciﬁed in Input Syntax Rules.
Error Tolerance Used in Regularizing User-Defined Data
It is not always desirable to regularize the input data so that they are reproduced exactly in a piecewise linear
manner. Suppose that the yield stress is deﬁned as a function of plastic strain in Abaqus/Explicit as follows:
Plastic Strain
Yield Stress
.0
50000
.001
75000
.003
80000
.010
85000
1.0
86000
It is possible to regularize the data exactly but it is not very economical, since it requires the subdivision of the
data into 1000 regular intervals. Regularization is more difﬁcult if the smallest interval you deﬁned is small
compared to the range of the independent variable.
Abaqus/Explicit uses an error tolerance to regularize the input data. The number of intervals in the range of each
independent variable is chosen such that the error between the piecewise linear regularized data and each of your
deﬁned points is less than the tolerance times the range of the dependent variable. In some cases the number of
intervals becomes excessive and Abaqus/Explicit cannot regularize the data using a reasonable number of
intervals. The number of intervals considered reasonable depends on the number of intervals that you deﬁne. If
you deﬁned 50 or less intervals, the maximum number of intervals used by Abaqus/Explicit for regularization
is equal to 100 times the number of user-deﬁned intervals. If you deﬁned more than 50 intervals, the maximum
number of intervals used for regularization is equal to 5000 plus 10 times the number of user-deﬁned intervals
above 50. If the number of intervals becomes excessive, the program stops during the data checking phase and
issues an error message. You can either redeﬁne the material data or change the tolerance value. The default
tolerance is 0.03.
The yield stress data in the example above are a typical case where such an error message might be issued. In
this case you can simply remove the last data point since it produces only a small difference in the ultimate yield
value.

Interpolation of Strain Rate–Dependent Data in Abaqus/Explicit
Because strain rate dependence of data is usually measured at logarithmic intervals, Abaqus/Explicit interpolates
strain rate data using logarithmic intervals rather than uniformly spaced intervals by default. This generally
provides a better match to typical strain rate–dependent curves. You can specify linear strain rate interpolation
to use uniform intervals for interpolation of strain rate data. The use of linear strain rate interpolation affects
only the interpolation of strain rate as an independent variable and is relevant only if one of the following
behaviors is used to deﬁne the material data:
•
low-density foams (Low-Density Foams)
•
rate-dependent metal plasticity (Classical Metal Plasticity)
•
rate-dependent viscoplasticity deﬁned by yield stress ratios (Rate-Dependent Yield)
•
shear failure deﬁned using direct tabular data (Dynamic Failure Models)
•
rate-dependent Drucker-Prager hardening (Extended Drucker-Prager Models)
•
rate-dependent concrete damaged plasticity (Concrete Damaged Plasticity)
•

Evaluation of Strain Rate–Dependent Data in Abaqus/Explicit
Rate-sensitive material constitutive behavior can introduce nonphysical high-frequency oscillations in an explicit
dynamic analysis. To overcome this problem, Abaqus/Explicit computes the equivalent plastic strain rate used
for the evaluation of strain rate–dependent data as
Here 
 is the incremental change in equivalent plastic strain during the time increment 
, and 
 and
 are the strain rates at the beginning and end of the increment, respectively. The factor  (
)
facilitates ﬁltering high-frequency oscillations associated with strain rate–dependent material behavior.
Abaqus/Explicit provides two options to specify the value of the strain rate factor, :
•
You can specify a constant value of . The default value is 0.9. A value of 
 does not provide the desired
ﬁltering effect; therefore, you should avoid this setting.
•
You can deﬁne a time-based ﬁlter by specifying a time constant, . In this case, the value of  is computed
as 
. This method produces ﬁltered results that are less sensitive to the changes in time
incrementation used for the analysis.

Overview
Some general rules apply for combining material behaviors in Abaqus.
Abaqus provides a broad range of possible material behaviors. A material is deﬁned by choosing the appropriate
behaviors for the purpose of an analysis. This section describes the general rules for combining material behaviors.
Speciﬁc information for each material behavior is also summarized at the end of each material behavior description
section in this chapter.
Some of the material behaviors in Abaqus are completely unrestricted: they can be used alone or together with other
behaviors. For example, thermal properties such as conductivity can be used in any material deﬁnition. They are used
in an analysis if the material is associated with elements that can solve heat transfer problems and if the analysis
procedure allows for the thermal equilibrium equation to be solved.
Some material behaviors in Abaqus require the presence of other material behaviors, and some exclude the use of other
material behaviors. For example, metal plasticity requires the deﬁnition of elastic material behavior or an equation of
state and excludes all other rate-independent plasticity behaviors.
Complete Material Definitions
Abaqus requires that the material be sufﬁciently deﬁned to provide suitable properties for those elements with
which the material is associated and for all analysis procedures through which the model will be run. Thus, a
material associated with displacement or structural elements must include either a “Complete mechanical”
category behavior or an “Elasticity” category behavior, as discussed below. In Abaqus/Explicit density (Density)
is required for all materials except hydrostatic ﬂuids.
It is impossible to modify or add to material deﬁnitions once an analysis is started. However, material deﬁnitions
can be modiﬁed in an import analysis. For example, a static analysis can be run in Abaqus/Standard using a
material deﬁnition that does not include a density speciﬁcation. Density can be added to the material deﬁnition
when the analysis is imported into Abaqus/Explicit.
All aspects of a material's behavior need not be fully deﬁned; any behavior that is omitted is assumed not to
exist in that part of the model. For example, if elastic material behavior is deﬁned for a metal but metal plasticity
is not deﬁned, the material is assumed not to have a yield stress. You must ensure that the material is adequately
deﬁned for the purpose of the analysis. The material can include behaviors that are not relevant for the analysis,
as described in About the Material Library. Thus, you can include general material behavior libraries, without
having to delete those behaviors that are not required for a particular application. This generality offers great
ﬂexibility in material modeling.
In Abaqus/Standard any material behaviors deﬁned using a distribution (Distribution Deﬁnition) can be combined
with almost all material behaviors in a manner identical to how they are combined when no distributions are
used. For example, if the linear elastic material behavior is deﬁned using a distribution, it can be combined with
37
Combining Material Behaviors

metal plasticity or any other material behavior that can normally be combined with linear elastic behavior. In
addition, more than one material behavior deﬁned with a distribution (linear elastic behavior and thermal
expansion, for example) can be included in the same material deﬁnition. The only exception is that a material
deﬁned with concrete damaged plasticity (Concrete Damaged Plasticity) cannot have any material behaviors
deﬁned with a distribution.
Material Behavior Combination Tables
The material behavior combination tables that follow explain which behaviors must be used together. The tables
also show the material behaviors that cannot be combined. Behaviors designated with an (S) are available only
in Abaqus/Standard; behaviors designated with an (E) are available only in Abaqus/Explicit.
The behaviors are assigned to categories because exclusions are best described in terms of those categories.
Some of the categories require explanation:
•
“Complete mechanical behaviors” are those behaviors in Abaqus that, individually, completely deﬁne a
material's mechanical (stress-strain) behavior. A behavior in this category, therefore, excludes any other such
behavior and also excludes any behavior that deﬁnes part of a material's mechanical behavior: those behaviors
that belong to the elasticity and plasticity categories.
•
“Elasticity, fabric, and equation of state behaviors” contains all the basic elasticity behaviors in Abaqus. If
a behavior from the “Complete mechanical behaviors” category is not used and mechanical behavior is
required, a behavior must be selected from this category. This selection then excludes any other elasticity
behavior.
•
“Enhancements for elasticity behaviors” contains behaviors that extend the modeling provided by the elasticity
behaviors in Abaqus.
•
“Rate-independent plasticity behaviors” contains all the basic plasticity behaviors in Abaqus except deformation
plasticity, which is in the “Complete mechanical behaviors” category because it completely deﬁnes the
material's mechanical behavior.
•
“Rate-dependent plasticity behaviors” contains behaviors that extend the modeling provided by the
rate-independent plasticity behaviors and by the linear elastic material behavior.
If elastic-plastic behavior must be modeled, you should select an appropriate plasticity behavior from one of the
plasticity behaviors categories and an elasticity behavior from one of the elasticity behaviors categories.

Overview
A material's mass density:
•
must be deﬁned in Abaqus/Standard for eigenfrequency and transient dynamic analysis, transient heat transfer
analysis, adiabatic stress analysis, and acoustic analysis;
•
must be deﬁned in Abaqus/Standard for gravity, centrifugal, and rotary acceleration loading;
•
must be deﬁned in Abaqus/Explicit for all materials except hydrostatic ﬂuids;
•
can be speciﬁed as a function of temperature and predeﬁned variables;
•
can be distributed from nonstructural features (such as paint on sheet metal panels in a car) to the underlying
elements using a nonstructural mass deﬁnition; and
•
can be deﬁned with a distribution for solid continuum elements in Abaqus/Standard.
Defining Density
Density can be deﬁned as a function of temperature and ﬁeld variables. Based on user-deﬁned data Abaqus
internally estimates the material density as follows:
•
For acoustic, heat transfer, and coupled thermal-electrical elements in Abaqus/Standard and acoustic elements
in Abaqus/Explicit, the density is continually updated to the value corresponding to the current temperature
and ﬁeld variables.
•
For coupled temperature-displacement elements in Abaqus/Standard, the density used in both heat transfer
and structural body force computations is assumed to be only a function of the initial temperature and ﬁeld
variables and changes in volume. This ensures mass conservation during the structural body force computations.
•
For all other elements in Abaqus/Standard and Abaqus/Explicit, the density is taken to be a function of the
initial temperature and ﬁeld variables and changes in volume only. It is not updated if temperatures and ﬁeld
variables change during the analysis.
In an Abaqus/Standard analysis, a spatially varying mass density can be deﬁned for homogeneous solid continuum
elements by using a distribution (Distribution Deﬁnition). The distribution must include a default value for the
density. If a distribution is used, no dependencies on temperature or ﬁeld variables for the density can be deﬁned.
Use either of the following options:

Abaqus/CAE Usage:
You can select Use temperature-dependent data to deﬁne the density as a function
of temperature or select the Number of ﬁeld variables to deﬁne the density as a

Units
Since Abaqus has no built-in dimensions, you must ensure that the density is given in consistent units. The use
of consistent units, and density in particular, is discussed in Conventions. If American or English units are used,
you must be particularly careful that the density used is in units of 
, where mass is deﬁned in units of
.
Elements
The density behavior described in this section is used to specify mass density for all elements, except rigid
elements. Mass density for rigid elements is speciﬁed as part of the rigid body deﬁnition (see Rigid Elements).
In Abaqus/Explicit, you must deﬁne a nonzero mass density for all elements that are not part of a rigid body. In
an undrained pore ﬂuid ﬂow and stress analysis, you must specify the density of the pore ﬂuid for the porous
medium if the elements are used with a permeating ﬂuid.
In Abaqus/Standard density must be deﬁned for heat transfer elements and acoustic elements; mass density can
be deﬁned for stress/displacement elements, coupled temperature-displacement elements, and elements including
pore pressure. For elements that include pore pressure as a degree of freedom, the density of the dry material
should be given for the porous medium in a coupled pore ﬂuid ﬂow/stress analysis.
If you have a complex density for an acoustic medium, you should enter its real part here and convert the
imaginary part into a volumetric drag, as discussed in Acoustic Medium.
The mass contribution from features that have negligible structural stiffness can be added to the model by
smearing the mass over an element set that is typically adjacent to the nonstructural feature. The nonstructural
mass can be speciﬁed in the form of a total mass value, a mass per unit volume, a mass per unit area, or a mass
per unit length (see Nonstructural Mass Deﬁnition). A nonstructural mass deﬁnition contributes additional mass
to the speciﬁed element set and does not alter the underlying material density.

Elastic Mechanical Properties

Elastic Behavior
Overview
The material library in Abaqus includes several models of elastic behavior.
Linear elasticity
Linear elasticity (Linear Elastic Behavior) is the simplest form of elasticity available in Abaqus. The linear
elastic model can deﬁne isotropic, orthotropic, or anisotropic material behavior and is valid for small elastic
strains.
Plane stress orthotropic failure
Failure measures (Plane Stress Orthotropic Failure Measures) are provided for use with linear elasticity as
indicators of material failure. They can be used to obtain postprocessed output requests based on the evaluation
of common failure theories for ﬁber-reinforced composite materials.
Porous elasticity
The porous elastic model in Abaqus/Standard (Elastic Behavior of Porous Materials) is used to study porous
materials with nonlinear pressure-dependent elastic behavior (including logarithmic or power laws). This form
of nonlinear elasticity is valid for small elastic strains.
Hypoelasticity
The hypoelastic model in Abaqus/Standard (Hypoelastic Behavior) is used for materials in which the rate of
change of stress is deﬁned by an elasticity matrix multiplying the rate of change of elastic strain, where the
elasticity matrix is a function of the total elastic strain. This general, nonlinear elasticity is valid for small elastic
strains.
Rubberlike hyperelasticity
The hyperelastic model for rubberlike materials (Hyperelastic Behavior of Rubberlike Materials) provides a
general capability for modeling the behavior of nearly incompressible elastomers under large elastic deformations.
Foam hyperelasticity
The hyperfoam model (Hyperelastic Behavior in Elastomeric Foams) provides a general capability for elastomeric
compressible foams at ﬁnite strains. This nonlinear elasticity model is valid for large strains (especially large
volumetric changes). The low-density foam model (Low-Density Foams) is a nonlinear viscoelastic model
suitable for specifying strain-rate sensitive behavior of low-density elastomeric foams such as used in crash and
impact applications. The crushable foam plasticity model (Crushable Foam Plasticity Models) is used to model
compressible foam materials that undergo permanent deformation.
47
Elastic Behavior

Anisotropic hyperelasticity
The anisotropic hyperelastic model (Anisotropic Hyperelastic Behavior) provides a general capability for modeling
materials that exhibit highly anisotropic and nonlinear elastic behavior (such as biomedical soft tissues and
ﬁber-reinforced elastomers). The model is valid for large elastic strains and captures the changes in the preferred
material directions (or ﬁber directions) with deformation.
Fabric materials
The fabric model in Abaqus/Explicit (Fabric Material Behavior) for woven fabrics captures the directional
nature of the stiffness along the ﬁll and the warp yarn directions. It also captures the shear response as the yarn
directions rotate relative to each other. The model takes into account ﬁnite strains including large shear rotations.
It captures the highly nonlinear elastic response of fabrics through the use of test data or a user subroutine,
VFABRIC (see VFABRIC) for the material characterization. The test data based fabric behavior can include
nonlinear elasticity, permanent deformation, rate-dependent response, and damage accumulation.
Viscoelasticity
The viscoelastic model is used to specify time-dependent material behavior (Time Domain Viscoelasticity). In
Abaqus/Standard it is also used to specify frequency-dependent material behavior (Frequency Domain
Viscoelasticity). It must be combined with linear elasticity, rubberlike hyperelasticity, or foam hyperelasticity.
Parallel rheological framework
The parallel rheological framework (Parallel Rheological Framework) is intended for modeling nonlinear
behavior for materials subjected to large strains, such as elastomers and polymers. The models deﬁned within
this framework consist of multiple parallel viscoelastic networks and, optionally, an elastoplastic network to
allow modeling permanent set and material softening using the Mullins effect. The elastic response is deﬁned
using the hyperelastic material model; the plastic response is based on the theory of incompressible isotropic
hardening plasticity; and the viscous response is speciﬁed using the ﬂow rule derived from a creep potential.
Hysteresis
The hysteresis model in Abaqus/Standard (Hysteresis in Elastomers) is used to specify rate-dependent behavior
of elastomers. It is used in conjunction with hyperelasticity.
Mullins effect
The Mullins effect model (Mullins Effect) is used to specify stress softening of ﬁlled rubber elastomers due to
damage, a phenomenon referred to as Mullins effect. The model can also be used to include permanent energy
dissipation and stress softening effects in elastomeric foams (Energy Dissipation in Elastomeric Foams). It is
used in conjunction with rubberlike hyperelasticity or foam hyperelasticity.
No compression or no tension elasticity
The no compression and no tension models (No Compression or No Tension) can be used when compressive or
tensile principal stresses should not be generated. These options can be used only with linear elasticity.

Elastic Behavior

References:
Thermal Strain
Thermal expansion can be introduced for any of the elasticity or fabric models (Thermal Expansion).
Elastic Strain Magnitude
Except in the hyperelasticity and fabric material models, the stresses are always assumed to be small compared
to the tangent modulus of the elasticity relationship; that is, the elastic strain must be small (less than 5%). The
total strain can be arbitrarily large if inelastic response such as metal plasticity is included in the material deﬁnition.
For ﬁnite-strain calculations where the large strains are purely elastic, the fabric model (for woven fabrics), the
hyperelastic model (for rubberlike behavior), or the foam hyperelasticity model (for elastomeric foams) should
be used. The hyperelasticity and fabric models are the only models that give realistic predictions of actual material
behavior at large elastic strains. The linear or, in Abaqus/Standard, porous elasticity models are appropriate in
other cases where the large strains are inelastic.
In Abaqus/Standard the linear elastic, porous elastic, and hypoelastic models will exhibit poor convergence
characteristics if the stresses reach levels of 50% or more of the elastic moduli; this limitation is not serious in
practical cases because these material models are not valid for the resulting large strains.

Overview
A linear elastic material model:
•
is valid for small elastic strains (normally less than 5%);
•
can be isotropic, transversely isotropic, orthotropic, or fully anisotropic;
•
can have properties that depend on temperature and other ﬁeld variables; and
•
can be deﬁned with a distribution for solid continuum elements in Abaqus/Standard.
Defining Linear Elastic Material Behavior
The total stress is deﬁned from the total elastic strain as
where  is the total stress (“true,” or Cauchy stress in ﬁnite-strain problems), 
 is the fourth-order elasticity
tensor, and 
 is the total elastic strain (log strain in ﬁnite-strain problems). Do not use the linear elastic material
deﬁnition when the elastic strains might become large; use a hyperelastic model instead. Even in ﬁnite-strain
problems the elastic strains should still be small (less than 5%).
Defining Linear Elastic Response for Viscoelastic Materials
The elastic response of a viscoelastic material (Time Domain Viscoelasticity) can be speciﬁed by deﬁning either
the instantaneous response or the long-term response of the material.
Instantaneous Response
To deﬁne the instantaneous response, experiments to determine the elastic constants must be performed within
time spans much shorter than the characteristic relaxation time of the material.

Directional Dependence of Linear Elasticity
Depending on the number of symmetry planes for the elastic properties, a material can be classiﬁed as either
isotropic (an inﬁnite number of symmetry planes passing through every point) or anisotropic (no symmetry
planes). Some materials have a restricted number of symmetry planes passing through every point; for example,
orthotropic materials have two orthogonal symmetry planes for the elastic properties. The number of independent
components of the elasticity tensor 
 depends on such symmetry properties. You deﬁne the level of anisotropy
and method of deﬁning the elastic properties, as described below. If the material is anisotropic, a local orientation
(Orientations) must be used to deﬁne the direction of anisotropy.
Stability of a Linear Elastic Material
Linear elastic materials must satisfy the conditions of material or Drucker stability (see the discussion on material
stability in Hyperelastic Behavior of Rubberlike Materials). Stability requires that the tensor 
 be positive
deﬁnite, which leads to certain restrictions on the values of the elastic constants. The stress-strain relations for
several different classes of material symmetries are given below. The appropriate restrictions on the elastic
constants stemming from the stability criterion are also given.
Defining Isotropic Elasticity
The simplest form of linear elasticity is the isotropic case, and the stress-strain relationship is given by
The elastic properties are completely deﬁned by giving the Young's modulus, E, and the Poisson's ratio, . The
shear modulus, G, can be expressed in terms of E and  as 
. These parameters can be given as
functions of temperature and of other predeﬁned ﬁelds, if necessary.
In Abaqus/Standard spatially varying isotropic elastic behavior can be deﬁned for homogeneous solid continuum
elements by using a distribution (Distribution Deﬁnition). The distribution must include default values for E and
. If a distribution is used, no dependencies on temperature and/or ﬁeld variables for the elastic constants can
be deﬁned.
For orthotropic elasticity under plane stress conditions, Abaqus/Standard computes the out-of-plane strain based
on the incompressibility assumption.

shells) or beams and trusses, such values require the use of “hybrid” elements in Abaqus/Standard and generate
high frequency noise and result in excessively small stable time increments in Abaqus/Explicit.
In Abaqus/Standard it is recommended that you use solid continuum hybrid elements for linear elastic materials
with Poisson's ratio greater than 0.495 (that is, the ratio of 
 greater than 100) to avoid potential convergence
problems. Otherwise, the analysis preprocessor will issue an error. You can use the “nonhybrid incompressible”
diagnostics control to downgrade this error to a warning message.

Cohesive Offset
A cohesive offset (Figure 1) refers to a value of the separation in the normal direction, 
, below which
the resistance to additional closure 
 of the cohesive surfaces increases signiﬁcantly. This
capability is useful in preventing the closure of a fracture when changes in external loading conditions might
otherwise result in closure. A practical application of this capability occurs during hydraulic fracturing with
slurry, where solid proppant particles (the solid part of the slurry) help "prop open" the fracture when external
hydraulic pressure loads are removed.

You can specify an offset to the separation in the normal direction for the following classes of cohesive elements:
•
pore pressure;
•
coupled temperature-pore pressure;
•
coupled slurry concentration-pore pressure; and
•
coupled temperature-slurry concentration-pore pressure.
You must specify the offset through user subroutine UCOHESIVEOFFSET. In addition to deﬁning an offset,
you can also deﬁne the stress or the Jacobian matrix for the traction-separation behavior.
If you do not deﬁne the stress in user subroutine UCOHESIVEOFFSET, Abaqus/Standard computes the normal
component of the effective traction as 
 for an uncoupled traction-separation response and
as 
 for coupled traction behavior. In the expressions above for

Defining Isotropic Shear Elasticity for Equations of State in Abaqus/Explicit

whose volumetric response is governed by an equation of state (Elastic Shear Behavior). In this case the deviatoric
stress-strain relationship is given by

•
Anisotropic:
You can deﬁne the transverse shear moduli for materials for which estimates of the shear moduli are unavailable
during the preprocessing stage of input; for example, when the material behavior is deﬁned by user subroutines
UMAT, UHYPEL, UHYPER, or VUMAT. You can also deﬁne the transverse shear moduli to override the default
values computed by a material behavior; for example, you can deﬁne anisotropic transverse shear moduli for an
isotropic elastic material.
The transverse shear moduli that you deﬁne are used only to compute the transverse shear stiffness at the beginning
of the analysis. Any change to the transverse shear moduli during the analysis is ignored. The transverse shear
moduli of a material are ignored if nondefault values of the transverse shear stiffness are speciﬁed for a section
that is associated with the material (see Deﬁning the Transverse Shear Stiffness for shell sections, Deﬁning the
Transverse Shear Stiffness for general shell sections, and Transverse Shear Stiffness Deﬁnition for beams).

Defining the Elasticity of a Short-Fiber Reinforced Composite
You can deﬁne the elasticity of a short-ﬁber reinforced composite (for example, an injection molded composite)
by specifying an orientation tensor (see Specifying a Second-Order Orientation Tensor in Abaqus/Standard and
Specifying a Second-Order Orientation Tensor in Abaqus/Explicit) and the elastic modulus of a unidirectional
(UD) composite. If the elasticity of the unidirectional composite is transversely isotropic (see Deﬁning Transversely
Isotropic Elasticity), the elasticity can then be computed using orientation averaging (Advani and Tucker, 1987):

 is the second-order orientation tensor; and 
 is the Kronecker delta. The fourth-order tensor 
 is computed
using the second-order orientation tensor with closure approximations (Cintra and Tucker, 1995). Predictions
of linear elastic properties are sensitive to the choice of closure approximation. Although there are many closure
formulations available in Abaqus, it is recommended to use the orthotropic ﬁtted (ORF) closure (Cintra and
Tucker, 1995) or orthotropic equaivalent of the natural (ORE) closure (VerWeyst, 1998) formulation when
predicting mechanical properties.
Abaqus uses the closure approximations that result in an orthotropic stiffness with the principal directions aligned
with those of the second-order orientation tensor. Since the elasticity is orthotropic, you must deﬁne the material
directions with local orientations (see Orientations), and the axes of the local system must align with the principal
directions of the second-order orientation tensor.

isotropic unidirectional composite:

Linear Elastic Behavior

Elements
Linear elasticity can be used with any stress/displacement element or coupled temperature-displacement element
in Abaqus. The exceptions are traction elasticity, which can be used only with 1-DOF warping elements and
cohesive elements; coupled traction elasticity, which can be used only with cohesive elements; shear elasticity,
which can be used only with solid (continuum) elements except plane stress elements; and, in Abaqus/Explicit,
anisotropic elasticity, which is not supported for truss, rebar, pipe, and beam elements.
If the material is (almost) incompressible (Poisson's ratio 
 for isotropic elasticity), hybrid elements
should be used in Abaqus/Standard. Compressible anisotropic elasticity should not be used with second-order
hybrid continuum elements: inaccurate results and/or convergence problems might occur.

Overview
Warning:
Except when used with truss or beam elements, Abaqus/Standard does not form an exact material stiffness for
this option. Therefore, the convergence can sometimes be slow.
The no compression and no tension elasticity models:
•
are used to modify the linear elasticity of the material so that compressive stress or tensile stress cannot be generated;
and
•
can be used only in conjunction with an elasticity deﬁnition.
Defining the Modified Elastic Behavior
The modiﬁed elastic behavior is obtained by ﬁrst solving for the principal stresses assuming linear elasticity and
then setting the appropriate principal stress values to zero. The associated stiffness matrix components will also
be set to zero. These models are not history dependent: the directions in which the principal stresses are set to
zero are recalculated at every iteration.
The no compression effect for a one-dimensional stress case such as a truss or a layer of a beam in a plane is
illustrated in Figure 1. No compression and no tension deﬁnitions modify only the elastic response of the material.

No Compression or No Tension

Stability
Using no compression or no tension elasticity can make a model unstable: convergence difﬁculties might occur.
Sometimes these difﬁculties can be overcome by overlaying each element that uses the no compression (or no
tension) model with another element that uses a small value of Young's modulus (small in comparison with the
Young's modulus of the element using modiﬁed elasticity). This technique creates a small “artiﬁcial” stiffness,
which can stabilize the model.
Material Options
No compression and no tension deﬁnitions can be used only in conjunction with an elasticity deﬁnition, which
can optionally include thermal expansion and material damping. These deﬁnitions cannot be used with any other
material option.
Elements
The no compression and no tension elasticity models can be used with any stress/displacement element. However,
they cannot be used with shell elements or beam elements if section properties are preintegrated using a general
section deﬁnition.

Overview
The orthotropic plane stress failure measures:
•
are indications of material failure (normally used for ﬁber-reinforced composite materials; for alternative damage
and failure models for ﬁber-reinforced composite materials, see About Damage and Failure for Fiber-Reinforced
Composites);
•
can be used only in conjunction with a linear elastic material model (with or without local material orientations);
•
can be used for any element that uses a plane stress formulation; that is, for plane stress continuum elements, shell
elements, and membrane elements;
•
are postprocessed output requests and do not cause any material degradation; and
•
take values that are greater than or equal to 0.0, with values that are greater than or equal to 1.0 implying failure.
Failure Theories
Five different failure theories are provided: four stress-based theories and one strain-based theory.
We denote orthotropic material directions by 1 and 2, with the 1-material direction aligned with the ﬁbers and
the 2-material direction transverse to the ﬁbers. For the failure theories to work correctly, the 1- and 2-directions
of the user-deﬁned elastic material constants must align with the ﬁber and the transverse-to-ﬁber directions,
respectively. For applications other than ﬁber-reinforced composites, the 1- and 2-material directions should
represent the strong and weak orthotropic-material directions, respectively.
In all cases tensile values must be positive and compressive values must be negative.
Stress-Based Failure Theories
The input data for the stress-based failure theories are tensile and compressive stress limits, 
 and 
, in the
1-direction; tensile and compressive stress limits, 
 and 
, in the 2-direction; and shear strength (maximum
shear stress), S, in the X–Y plane.
All four stress-based theories are deﬁned and available with a single deﬁnition in Abaqus; the desired output is
chosen by the output variables described at the end of this section.

Stress-Based Failure Measures—Failure Envelopes
To illustrate the four stress-based failure measures, Figure 1, Figure 2, and Figure 3 show each failure envelope
(i.e., 
) in (
–
) stress space compared to the Tsai-Hill envelope for a given value of in-plane shear
stress. In each case the Tsai-Hill surface is the piecewise continuous elliptical surface with each quadrant of the
surface deﬁned by an ellipse centered at the origin. The parallelogram in Figure 1 deﬁnes the maximum stress
surface. In Figure 2 the Tsai-Wu surface appears as the ellipse. In Figure 3 the Azzi-Tsai-Hill surface differs
from the Tsai-Hill surface only in the second and fourth quadrants, where it is the outside bounding surface (i.e.,
further from the origin). Since all of the failure theories are calibrated by tensile and compressive failure under
uniaxial stress, they all give the same values on the stress axes.

Abaqus provides output of the failure index, R, if failure measures are deﬁned with the material description. The
deﬁnition of the failure index and the different output variables are described below.
Output Failure Indices
Each of the stress-based failure theories deﬁnes a failure surface surrounding the origin in the three-dimensional
space

index, R, is used to measure the proximity to the failure surface. R is deﬁned as the scaling factor such that, for

Output variable CFAILURE will provide output for all of the stress- and strain-based failure theories (see

history output can also be requested for the individual stress theories with output variables MSTRS, TSAIH,
TSAIW, and AZZIT and for the strain theory with output variable MSTRN.
Output variables for the stress- and strain-based failure theories are always calculated at the material points of
the element. In Abaqus/Standard element output can be requested at a location other than the material points
(see Output to the Data and Results Files); in this case the output variables are ﬁrst calculated at the material

Plasticity Corrections
Products:
Abaqus/Standard
References:
• *PLASTICITY CORRECTION
Overview
Plasticity corrections:
•
provide an estimate of the plastic solution for a model analyzed with purely elastic material response;
•
can be applied to an isotropic linear elastic material model in general and static linear perturbation procedures;
•
can be used with elastic-plastic materials with an isotropic von Mises yield surface (however, the correction is
evaluated only in static perturbation procedures, where the material response is elastic);
•
are meaningful only when plastic deformation is localized in small regions of the structure;
•
are evaluated using the Neuber or Glinka rules;
•
are based on either a tabular stress-strain curve or the Ramberg-Osgood deﬁnition of the plastic response of the
material; and
•
have no effect on the solution (additional output is provided only through postprocessing of a linear elastic solution).
Neuber and Glinka Plasticity Corrections
Many types of engineering applications require the solution of nonlinear elastic-plastic problems. The ﬁnite
element analysis method provides a robust way of obtaining such results accurately. However, performing a
nonlinear, elastic-plastic analysis can be computationally expensive.
The Neuber and Glinka plasticity correction rules available in Abaqus/Standard provide an effective method to
approximate the elastic-plastic stress and strain solution by performing only a linear elastic analysis, which can
signiﬁcantly reduce the computational cost. This is particularly important in concept design optimization
workﬂows, where the analysis must be performed multiple times. The plasticity correction capabilities are also
supported in static linear perturbation steps with multiple load cases, which can further substantially decrease
the computational cost of the analysis.
The plasticity corrections provide postprocessed output results based on the evaluation of the Neuber or Glinka
rules applied to a linear elastic response, but they do not affect the linear solution. To trigger the evaluation of
plasticity corrections, you must request one of the output variables described in Output.
Specifying the Plastic Response
Although the output variables associated with the Neuber and Glinka corrections are available only when the
material response is purely elastic, their evaluation still requires knowledge of the plastic properties of the
material. The plastic properties are used only to evaluate the additional plasticity corrections output variables;
other solution results, which are based on linear elasticity, are not affected. You can deﬁne the plastic response
for the evaluation of plasticity corrections by specifying:
•
the coefﬁcients of the Ramberg-Osgood model,
•
the tabular deﬁnition of the hardening curve, or
•
an elastic-plastic material deﬁnition with isotropic von Mises plasticity.
73
Plasticity Corrections

In the latter case, the plasticity corrections are evaluated only in static perturbation procedures, where the material
response is always assumed to be purely elastic.
Ramberg-Osgood Definition
The Ramberg-Osgood model is based on the observation that the stress versus plastic strain response is linear
when plotted in the logarithmic scale (that is, it has a power law relation). In this model, the total strain is
decomposed into the elastic and plastic components:
where  is the equivalent strain,  is the equivalent stress,  is the Young's modulus, and 
 and  are material
parameters.

The plasticity corrections can be evaluated using the plastic response speciﬁed in an elastic-plastic material
deﬁnition with an isotropic von Mises yield surface. The deﬁnition of the hardening curve is provided as a table
of yield stresses versus equivalent plastic strains, similar to the tabular deﬁnition discussed above. However, in
this case, output variables for the plasticity corrections are evaluated only in static linear perturbation procedures,
where the material response is always assumed to be elastic. They are not available in general procedures, which
always compute a fully nonlinear elastic-plastic solution.
Neuber's Rule
Neuber’s rule is one of the most widely used methods for estimating the elastic-plastic stress and strain response
from purely elastic stress results. It assumes that the stress-strain product of the elastic solution is equal to the
stress-strain product of the elastic-plastic solution. It can be expressed as
This equation is depicted graphically in Figure 1 and means that the areas of the two triangles shown must be
equal. The dashed line is called the Neuber hyperbola, and the solution to the problem lies on the intersection

74

of this line with the elastic-plastic curve. To obtain Neuber's stress and strain (
 and

above equation together with the relationship describing the plastic response.

Glinka's Rule
Glinka’s rule, also known as the equivalent strain energy density method (ESED), is based on the assumption
that the strain energy density distribution in the localized plastic region near a notch is the same as that predicted
from a linear elastic solution. This approach generally leads to smaller values of stress and strain compared to
Neuber’s rule.
The corrected stress-strain response corresponds to a point on the elastic-plastic curve such that the area under
the curve is equal to the area of the triangle under the purely elastic response, as shown in Figure 2. The ﬁgure
also shows the triangle representing the Neuber response for comparison. Glinka's rule can be expressed as

Plasticity Corrections in Static Perturbation Procedures
When the static perturbation step follows a general step, Abaqus/Standard calculates the elastic stress (
) that
is used to evaluate the plasticity corrections as the sum of the base stress and the perturbation stress. In addition,
if you request plasticity corrections for elements that have an elastic-plastic material deﬁnition, Abaqus/Standard
evaluates the corrections taking into account the fully nonlinear elastic-plastic state of the material at the end of
the general step. In this case, Abaqus/Standard uses the modiﬁed Neuber and Glinka rules, graphically depicted

in Figure 3 and Figure 4, to compute the corrected stresses and strains. Abaqus/Standard evaluates the yield
stress, taking into account the value of equivalent plastic strain in the base state and shifting the strain to account
for the change of the stress-free conﬁguration.

Overview
The porous elastic models:
•
are used to study the pressure-dependent elastic behavior of materials;
•
include a logarithmic model and a power law–based model; and
•
can have properties that depend on temperature and other ﬁeld variables.
Logarithmic Porous Elasticity Model
The logarithmic porous elasticity model is valid for small elastic strains (normally less than 5%). It is a nonlinear,
isotropic elasticity model in which the pressure stress varies as an exponential function of volumetric strain. The
model allows a zero or nonzero elastic tensile stress limit.
Defining the Volumetric Behavior
Often, the elastic part of the volumetric behavior of porous materials is modeled accurately by assuming that
the elastic part of the change in volume of the material is proportional to the logarithm of the pressure stress
(Figure 1):

Elastic Behavior of Porous Materials

The power law–based porous elasticity model can be combined with:
•
the soft rock plasticity model; or
•
isotropic expansion to introduce thermal volume changes (Thermal Expansion).
It is not possible to use porous elasticity with rate-dependent plasticity or viscoelasticity.
Porous elasticity cannot be used with the porous metal plasticity model (Porous Metal Plasticity).
See Combining Material Behaviors for more details.
Elements
Porous elasticity cannot be used with hybrid elements or plane stress elements (including shells and membranes),
but it can be used with any other pure stress/displacement element in Abaqus/Standard.
If used with reduced-integration elements with total-stiffness hourglass control, Abaqus/Standard cannot calculate
a default value for the hourglass stiffness of the element if the logarithmic porous elasticity model is used and
the shear behavior is deﬁned through Poisson's ratio. Hence, you must specify the hourglass stiffness. See Section
Controls for details.
If ﬂuid pore pressure is important (such as in undrained soils), stress/displacement elements that include pore
pressure can be used.

Overview
The hypoelastic material model:
•
is valid for small elastic strains—the stresses should not be large compared to the elastic modulus of the material;
•
is used when the load path is monotonic; and
•
must be deﬁned by user subroutine UHYPEL if temperature dependence is to be included.
Defining Hypoelastic Material Behavior
In a hypoelastic material the rate of change of stress is deﬁned as a tangent modulus matrix multiplying the rate
of change of the elastic strain:
where 
 is the rate of change of the stress (the “true,” Cauchy, stress in ﬁnite-strain problems), 
 is the
tangent elasticity matrix, and

For the purpose of deﬁning the above invariants, it is assumed that

be incompressible. For example, in a uniaxial stress case (such as a truss element) this assumption implies that
Large-Displacement Analysis
For large-displacement analysis the strain measure in Abaqus is the integration of the rate of deformation. This
strain measure corresponds to log strain if the principal directions do not rotate relative to the material. The strain
invariant deﬁnitions should be interpreted in this way.
Material Options
The hypoelastic material model can be used only by itself in the material deﬁnition. It cannot be combined with
viscoelasticity or with any inelastic response model. See Combining Material Behaviors for more details.

Overview
The hyperelastic material model:
•
is isotropic and nonlinear;
•
is valid for materials that exhibit instantaneous elastic response up to large strains (such as rubber, solid propellant,
or other elastomeric materials); and
•
requires that geometric nonlinearity be accounted for during the analysis step (General and Perturbation Procedures),
since it is intended for ﬁnite-strain applications.
Compressibility
Most elastomers (solid, rubberlike materials) have very little compressibility compared to their shear ﬂexibility.
This behavior does not warrant special attention for plane stress, shell, membrane, beam, truss, or rebar elements,
but the numerical solution can be quite sensitive to the degree of compressibility for three-dimensional solid,
plane strain, and axisymmetric analysis elements. In cases where the material is highly conﬁned (such as an
O-ring used as a seal), the compressibility must be modeled correctly to obtain accurate results. In applications
where the material is not highly conﬁned, the degree of compressibility is typically not crucial; for example, it
would be quite satisfactory in Abaqus/Standard to assume that the material is fully incompressible: the volume
of the material cannot change except for thermal expansion.
Another class of rubberlike materials is elastomeric foam, which is elastic but very compressible. Elastomeric
foams are discussed in Hyperelastic Behavior in Elastomeric Foams.
We can assess the relative compressibility of a material by the ratio of its initial bulk modulus, 
, to its initial
shear modulus, 
. This ratio can also be expressed in terms of Poisson's ratio, , since
The table below provides some representative values.

Compressibility in Abaqus/Standard
In Abaqus/Standard it is recommended that you use solid continuum hybrid elements for almost incompressible
hyperelastic materials with an initial Poisson's ratio greater than 0.495 (that is, the ratio of 
 is greater than
100) to avoid potential convergence problems. Otherwise, the analysis preprocessor issues an error. Except for
fully incompressible hyperelastic materials, you can use the “nonhybrid incompressible” diagnostics control to
downgrade this error to a warning message.
In plane stress, shell, and membrane elements the material is free to deform in the thickness direction. Similarly,
in one-dimensional elements (such as beams, trusses, and rebars) the material is free to deform in the lateral
directions. In these cases, special treatment of the volumetric behavior is not necessary; the use of regular
stress/displacement elements is satisfactory.
Use the following option to downgrade an error message to a warning message:
Input File Usage:
*DIAGNOSTICS, NONHYBRID INCOMPRESSIBLE=WARNING
Compressibility in Abaqus/Explicit
Except for plane stress and uniaxial cases, it is not possible to assume that the material is fully incompressible
in Abaqus/Explicit because the program has no mechanism for imposing such a constraint at each material
calculation point. Instead, we must provide some compressibility. The difﬁculty is that, in many cases, the actual
material behavior provides too little compressibility for the algorithms to work efﬁciently. Thus, except for plane
stress and uniaxial cases, you must provide enough compressibility for the code to work, knowing that this makes
the bulk behavior of the model softer than that of the actual material. Some judgment is, therefore, required to
decide whether or not the solution is sufﬁciently accurate, or whether the problem can be modeled at all with
Abaqus/Explicit because of this numerical limitation.
If no value is given for the material compressibility in the hyperelastic model, by default Abaqus/Explicit assumes
 20, corresponding to Poisson's ratio of 0.475. Since typical unﬁlled elastomers have 
 ratios in
the range of 1,000 to 10,000 (
 0.4995 to 
 0.49995) and ﬁlled elastomers have 
 ratios in the range
of 50 to 200 (
 0.490 to 
 0.497), this default provides much more compressibility than is available in
most elastomers. However, if the elastomer is relatively unconﬁned, this softer modeling of the material's bulk
behavior usually provides quite accurate results. Unfortunately, in cases where the material is highly
conﬁned—such as when it is in contact with stiff, metal parts and has a very small amount of free surface,
especially when the loading is highly compressive—it might not be feasible to obtain accurate results with
Abaqus/Explicit.
If you are deﬁning the compressibility rather than accepting the default value, an upper limit of 100 is suggested
for the ratio of 
. Larger ratios introduce high frequency noise into the dynamic solution and require the
use of excessively small time increments.

Isotropy Assumption
In Abaqus all hyperelastic models are based on the assumption of isotropic behavior throughout the deformation
history. Hence, the strain energy potential can be formulated as a function of the strain invariants.
Strain Energy Potentials
Hyperelastic materials are described in terms of a “strain energy potential,” 
, which deﬁnes the strain energy
stored in the material per unit of reference volume (volume in the initial conﬁguration) as a function of the strain
at that point in the material. The following forms of strain energy potentials available in Abaqus to model
approximately incompressible isotropic elastomers:
•
Arruda-Boyce
•
Hencky
•
Marlow
•
Mooney-Rivlin
•
Neo-Hookean
•
Ogden
•
Polynomial
•
Reduced polynomial
•
Yeoh
•
Valanis-Landel
•
Van der Waals
You can view the reduced polynomial and Mooney-Rivlin models as particular cases of the polynomial model.
In turn, you can view the Yeoh and neo-Hookean potentials as special cases of the reduced polynomial model.
Therefore, we occasionally refer collectively to these models as “polynomial models.”
Generally, when data from multiple experimental tests are available (typically, this requires at least uniaxial and
equibiaxial test data), the Ogden and Van der Waals forms are more accurate in ﬁtting experimental results. If
limited test data are available for calibration, the Arruda-Boyce, Van der Waals, Yeoh, or reduced polynomial
forms provide reasonable behavior. When only uniaxial test data is available, the Marlow or the Valanis-Landel
form is recommended. If only equibiaxial or planar test data is available, the Marlow form is recommended. In
this case, a strain energy potential is constructed that reproduces the test data exactly and that has reasonable
behavior in other deformation modes.
The Hencky model does not support the speciﬁcation of test data input for its deﬁnition. This model provides a
ﬁnite strain alternative to the isotropic linear elastic deﬁnition (Deﬁning Isotropic Elasticity).
Evaluating Hyperelastic Materials
Abaqus/CAE allows you to evaluate hyperelastic material behavior by automatically creating response curves
using selected strain energy potentials. In addition, you can provide experimental test data for a material without
specifying a particular strain energy potential and have Abaqus/CAE evaluate the material to determine the
optimal strain energy potential. See Evaluating hyperelastic, hyperfoam and viscoelastic material behavior for
details. Alternatively, you can use single-element test cases to evaluate the strain energy potential.

Defining the Hyperelastic Material Response
The mechanical response of a material is deﬁned by choosing a strain energy potential to ﬁt the particular
material. The strain energy potential forms in Abaqus are written as separable functions of a deviatoric component
and a volumetric component; that is, 
. Alternatively, you can deﬁne the strain
energy potential with user subroutines UHYPER and UHYPER_STRETCH in Abaqus/Standard, or in VUHYPER
in Abaqus/Explicit, in which case the strain energy potential need not be separable.
Generally for the hyperelastic material models available in Abaqus, you can either directly specify material
coefﬁcients or provide experimental test data and have Abaqus automatically determine appropriate values of
the coefﬁcients. An exception is the Marlow form: in this case, the deviatoric part of the strain energy potential
must be deﬁned with test data. The different methods for deﬁning the strain energy potential are described in
detail below.
The properties of rubberlike materials can vary signiﬁcantly from one batch to another; therefore, if data are
used from several experiments, all the experiments should be performed on specimens taken from the same batch
of material, regardless of whether you or Abaqus compute the coefﬁcients.
Viscoelastic and Hysteretic Materials
The elastic response of viscoelastic materials (Time Domain Viscoelasticity and Parallel Rheological Framework)
and hysteretic materials (Hysteresis in Elastomers) can be speciﬁed by deﬁning either the instantaneous response
or the long-term response of such materials.
Instantaneous Response
To deﬁne the instantaneous response, the experiments outlined in Experimental Tests have to be performed
within time spans much shorter than the characteristic relaxation times of these materials.

Accounting for Compressibility
Compressibility can be deﬁned by specifying nonzero values for 
 (except for the Marlow, Valanis-Landel
and Hencky models), by setting the Poisson's ratio to a value less than 0.5, or by providing test data that
characterize the compressibility. The test data method is described later in this section. If you specify the Poisson's
ratio for hyperelasticity other than the Marlow or the Valanis-Landel models, Abaqus computes the initial bulk
modulus from the initial shear modulus
For the Marlow model and the Valanis-Landel model the speciﬁed Poisson's ratio represents a constant value,
which determines the volumetric response throughout the deformation process. If 
 is equal to zero, all the 
must be equal to zero. In such a case the material is assumed to be fully incompressible in Abaqus/Standard,
while Abaqus/Explicit assumes compressible behavior with 
 (Poisson's ratio of 0.475).

Using Test Data to Calibrate Material Coefficients
The material coefﬁcients of the hyperelastic models can be calibrated by Abaqus from experimental stress-strain
data, except for the Hencky model. In the case of the Marlow and Valanis-Landel models, the test data directly
characterize the strain energy potential (there are no material coefﬁcients for these models); these models are
described in detail below. The value of N and experimental stress-strain data can be speciﬁed for up to four
simple tests: uniaxial, equibiaxial, planar, and, if the material is compressible, a volumetric compression test.
Abaqus will then compute the material parameters. The material constants are determined through a
least-squares-ﬁt procedure, which minimizes the relative error in stress. For the n nominal-stress–nominal-strain
data pairs, the relative error measure E is minimized, where
 is a stress value from the test data, and 
 comes from one of the nominal stress expressions derived below
(see “Experimental tests”). Abaqus minimizes the relative error rather than an absolute error measure since this
provides a better ﬁt at lower strains. This method is available for all strain energy potentials and any order of N
except for the polynomial form, where a maximum of 
 is allowed. The polynomial models are linear in
terms of the constants 
; therefore, a linear least-squares procedure can be used. The Arruda-Boyce, Ogden,
and Van der Waals potentials are nonlinear in some of their coefﬁcients, thus necessitating the use of a nonlinear
least-squares procedure. Fitting of hyperelastic and hyperfoam constants contains a detailed derivation of the
related equations.
It is generally best to obtain data from several experiments involving different kinds of deformation over the
range of strains of interest in the actual application and to use all of these data to determine the parameters. This
is particularly true for the phenomenological models; that is, the Ogden and the polynomial models. It has been
observed that to achieve good accuracy and stability, it is necessary to ﬁt these models using test data from more
than one deformation state. In some cases, especially at large strains, removing the dependence on the second
invariant might alleviate this limitation. The Arruda-Boyce, neo-Hookean, and Van der Waals models with  =
0 offer a physical interpretation and provide a better prediction of general deformation modes when the parameters
are based on only one test. An extensive discussion of this topic can be found in Hyperelastic material behavior.
This method does not allow the hyperelastic properties to be temperature dependent. However, if
temperature-dependent test data are available, several curve ﬁts can be conducted by performing a data check
analysis on a simple input ﬁle. The temperature-dependent coefﬁcients determined by Abaqus can then be entered
directly in the actual analysis run.
Optionally, the parameter  in the Van der Waals model can be set to a ﬁxed value while the other parameters
are found using a least-squares curve ﬁt.
As many data points as required can be entered from each test. It is recommended that data from all four tests
(on samples taken from the same piece of material) be included and that the data points cover the range of nominal

strains expected to arise in the actual loading. For the (general) polynomial and Ogden models and for the
coefﬁcient  in the Van der Waals model, the planar test data must be accompanied by the uniaxial test data,
the biaxial test data, or both of these types of test data; otherwise, the solution to the least-squares ﬁt will not be
unique.
The strain data should be given as nominal strain values (change in length per unit of original length). For the
uniaxial, equibiaxial, and planar tests stress data are given as nominal stress values (force per unit of original
cross-sectional area). These tests allow for entering both compression and tension data. Compressive stresses
and strains are entered as negative values.
If compressibility is to be speciﬁed, the 
 or D can be computed from volumetric compression test data.
Alternatively, compressibility can be deﬁned by specifying a Poisson's ratio, in which case Abaqus computes
the bulk modulus from the initial shear modulus. If no such data are given, Abaqus/Standard assumes that D or
all the 
 are zero, whereas Abaqus/Explicit assumes compressibility corresponding to a Poisson's ratio of 0.475
(see “Compressibility in Abaqus/Explicit” above). For these compression tests the stress data are given as pressure
values.

Alternatively, you can select Strain energy potential: Unknown to deﬁne the
material temporarily without specifying a particular strain energy potential. Then
select Material->Evaluate to have Abaqus/CAE evaluate the material to determine
the optimal strain energy potential.
Specifying the Marlow Model
The Marlow model assumes that the strain energy potential is independent of the second deviatoric invariant
. This model is deﬁned by providing test data that deﬁne the deviatoric behavior, and, optionally, the volumetric
behavior if compressibility must be taken into account. Abaqus will construct a strain energy potential that
reproduces the test data exactly, as shown in Figure 1.
MARLOW
TEST DATA
Figure 1:The results of the Marlow model with test data.
The interpolation and extrapolation of stress-strain data with the Marlow model is approximately linear for small
and large strains. For intermediate strains in the range 0.1 to 1.0 a noticeable degree of nonlinearity might be
observed in the interpolation/extrapolation with the Marlow model; for example, some nonlinearity is apparent
between the 4th and 5th data points in Figure 1. To minimize undesirable nonlinearity, make sure that enough
data points are speciﬁed in the intermediate strain range.
The deviatoric behavior is deﬁned by specifying uniaxial, biaxial, or planar test data. Generally, you can specify
either the data from tension tests or the data from compression tests because the tests are equivalent (see Equivalent
Experimental Tests). However, for beams, trusses, and rebars, the data from tension and compression tests can
be speciﬁed together. Volumetric behavior is deﬁned by using one of the following three methods:
•
Specify nominal lateral strains, in addition to nominal stresses and nominal strains, as part of the uniaxial,
biaxial, or planar test data.
•
Specify Poisson's ratio for the hyperelastic material.
•
Specify volumetric test data directly. Both hydrostatic tension and hydrostatic compression data can be
speciﬁed. If only hydrostatic compression data are available, as is usually the case, Abaqus will assume that
the hydrostatic pressure is an antisymmetric function of the nominal volumetric strain, 
.
Abaqus Materials Guide
98
Hyperelastic Behavior of Rubberlike Materials

If you do not deﬁne volumetric behavior, Abaqus/Standard assumes fully incompressible behavior, while
Abaqus/Explicit assumes compressibility corresponding to a Poisson's ratio of 0.475.
Material test data in which the stress does not vary smoothly with increasing strain might lead to convergence
difﬁculty during the simulation. It is highly recommended that smooth test data be used to deﬁne the Marlow
form. Abaqus provides a smoothing algorithm, which is described in detail later in this section.
The test data for the Marlow model can also be given as a function of temperature and ﬁeld variables. You must
specify the number of user-deﬁned ﬁeld variable dependencies required.
Uniaxial, biaxial, and planar test data must be given in ascending order of the nominal strains; volumetric test
data must be given in descending order of the volume ratio.

the material. If you included temperature dependencies, ﬁeld variable dependencies,
or lateral nominal strain in the test data—which can only be deﬁned in the Marlow
hyperelastic deﬁnition—Marlow will be the only strain energy potential available
for evaluation.
Specifying the Valanis-Landel Model
In general, the deviatoric part of the strain energy potential of the Valanis-Landel model depends on both the
ﬁrst, 
, and the second, 
, deviatoric invariants. You deﬁne this model by providing test data and, optionally,
the Poisson's ratio. Abaqus constructs a strain energy potential that reproduces the test data exactly.

Hyperelastic Behavior of Rubberlike Materials

You deﬁne the deviatoric behavior by specifying uniaxial test data or uniaxial and biaxial test data. If the deviatoric
behavior is deﬁned by specifying only uniaxial test data, you must provide data from both tension and compression
tests together for this model. If the deviatoric behavior is deﬁned by specifying both uniaxial and biaxial test
data, you must provide data from tension tests only in both cases. In this case, Abaqus will convert the tensile
biaxial data into compressive uniaxial test data since both data sets are equivalent (see Figure 3). The conversion
is performed by assuming that the deformations are incompressible. It can be shown (using the relations provided
in Experimental Tests) that the uniaxial nominal stress, 
, and the nominal strain, 
, can be obtained from the
following relations:
and
where 
 and 
 are the nominal biaxial strain and stress, respectively.
Volumetric behavior is deﬁned by using one of the following methods:
•
Specify nominal lateral strains, in addition to nominal stresses and nominal strains, as part of the uniaxial
test data.
•
Specify Poisson's ratio for the hyperelastic material.
•
Specify volumetric test data directly. You can specify both hydrostatic tension and hydrostatic compression
data. If only hydrostatic compression data are available, as is usually the case, Abaqus assumes that the
hydrostatic pressure is an antisymmetric function of the nominal volumetric strain, 
.
If a Poisson's ratio of 0.5 is speciﬁed, the material behavior is assumed to be fully incompressible in
Abaqus/Standard.
Material test data in which the stress does not vary smoothly with increasing strain can lead to convergence
difﬁculty during the simulation. It is highly recommended that you use smooth test data to deﬁne the
Valanis-Landel form. Abaqus provides a smoothing algorithm, which is described in detail later in this section.
The test data for the Valanis-Landel model can also be given as a function of temperature and ﬁeld variables.
You must specify the number of user-deﬁned ﬁeld variable dependencies required.

User Subroutine Specification in Abaqus/Standard
An alternative method provided in Abaqus/Standard for deﬁning the hyperelastic material parameters allows
the strain energy potential to be deﬁned in user subroutine UHYPER or in user subroutine UHYPER_STRETCH.
You can specify either compressible or incompressible behavior. Optionally, you can specify the number of
property values needed as data in the user subroutine. If needed, you can specify the number of solution-dependent
variables (see About User Subroutines and Utilities).
User subroutine UHYPER requires that the values of the derivatives of the strain energy density function of the
hyperelastic material are deﬁned with respect to the strain invariants.
User subroutine UHYPER_STRETCH assumes that the strain energy potential uses the Valanis-Landel form. It
requires that the values of the derivatives of the strain energy density function of the hyperelastic material are
deﬁned with respect to the principal deviatoric stretches, 
, and elastic volume ratio,

is not supported in user subroutine VUHYPER for plane strain, axisymmetric, and three-dimensional solid
elements. However, for elements with reduced stress state (plane stress, beam, and uniaxial elements), user
subroutine VUHYPER assumes fully incompressible behavior and the derivatives of strain energy with respect
to the third invariant are ignored. Optionally, you can specify the number of properties values needed as data in

Combine data from these three test types to get a good characterization of the hyperelastic material behavior.
For the incompressible version of the material model, the stress-strain relationships for the different tests are
developed using derivatives of the strain energy function with respect to the strain invariants. We deﬁne these
relations in terms of the nominal stress (the force divided by the original, undeformed area) and the nominal, or
engineering, strain deﬁned below.

The uniaxial tension test is the most common of all the tests and is usually performed by pulling a “dog-bone”
specimen. The uniaxial compression test is performed by loading a compression button between lubricated
surfaces. The loading surfaces are lubricated to minimize any barreling effect in the button that would cause
deviations from a homogeneous uniaxial compression stress-strain state.

In practice, the equibiaxial compression test is rarely performed because of experimental setup difﬁculties. In
addition, this deformation mode is equivalent to a uniaxial tension test, which is straightforward to conduct.
A more common test is the equibiaxial tension test, in which a stress state with two equal tensile stresses and
zero shear stress is created. This state is usually achieved by stretching a square sheet in a biaxial testing machine.
It can also be obtained by inﬂating a circular membrane into a spheroidal shape (like blowing up a balloon). The
stress ﬁeld in the middle of the membrane then closely approximates equibiaxial tension, provided that the
thickness of the membrane is very much smaller than the radius of curvature at this point. However, the strain
distribution will not be quite uniform, and local strain measurements will be required. Once the strain and radius
of curvature are known, the nominal stress can be derived from the inﬂation pressure.

For the (general) polynomial and Ogden models and for the coefﬁcient  in the Van der Waals model this
equation alone will not determine the constants uniquely. The planar test data must be augmented by uniaxial
test data and/or biaxial test data to determine the material parameters.
Planar tests are usually done with a thin, short, and wide rectangular strip of material ﬁxed on its wide edges to
rigid loading clamps that are moved apart. If the separation direction is the 1-direction and the thickness direction
is the 3-direction, the comparatively long size of the specimen in the 2-direction and the rigid clamps allow us
to use the approximation 
; that is, there is no deformation in the wide direction of the specimen. This
deformation mode could also be called planar compression if the 3-direction is considered to be the primary
direction. All forms of incompressible plane strain behavior are characterized by this deformation mode.
Consequently, if plane strain analysis is performed, planar test data represent the relevant form of straining of
the material.

will be obtained and time increments will be excessively small (see “Compressibility in Abaqus/Explicit” above).

An approximate way of conducting a volumetric test consists of using a cylindrical rubber specimen that ﬁts
snugly inside a rigid container and whose top surface is compressed by a rigid piston. Although both volumetric
and deviatoric deformation are present, the deviatoric stresses will be several orders of magnitude smaller than
the hydrostatic stresses (because the bulk modulus is much higher than the shear modulus) and can be neglected.
The compressive stress imposed by the rigid piston is effectively the pressure, and the volumetric strain in the
rubber cylinder is computed from the piston displacement.

Hyperelastic Behavior of Rubberlike Materials

Smoothing the Test Data
Experimental test data often contain noise in the sense that the test variable is both slowly varying and also
corrupted by random noise. This noise can affect the quality of the strain energy potential that Abaqus derives.
This noise is particularly a problem with the Marlow form, where a strain energy potential that exactly describes
the test data that are used to calibrate the model is computed. It is less of a concern with the other forms, since
smooth functions are ﬁtted through the test data.
Abaqus provides a smoothing technique to remove the noise from the test data based on the Savitzky-Golay
method. The idea is to replace each data point by a local average of its surrounding data points, so that the level
of noise can be reduced without biasing the dominant trend of the test data. In the implementation a cubic
polynomial is ﬁtted through each data point i and n data points to the immediate left and right of that point. A
least-squares method is used to ﬁt the polynomial through these 
 points. The value of data point i is then
replaced by the value of the polynomial at the same position. Each polynomial is used to adjust one data point
except near the ends of the curve, where a polynomial is used to adjust multiple points, because the ﬁrst and last
few points cannot be the center of the ﬁtting set of data points. This process is applied repeatedly to all data
points until two consecutive passes through the data produce nearly the same results.
By default, the test data are not smoothed. If smoothing is speciﬁed, the default value is n=3. Alternatively, you
can specify the number of data points to the left and right of a data point in the moving window within which a
least-squares polynomial is ﬁt.
For the Marlow form, use one of the ﬁrst three options and, optionally, the fourth

Model Prediction of Material Behavior Versus Experimental Data
Once the strain energy potential is determined, the behavior of the hyperelastic model in Abaqus is established.
However, the quality of this behavior must be assessed: the prediction of material behavior under different
deformation modes must be compared against the experimental data. You must judge whether the strain energy
potentials determined by Abaqus are acceptable, based on the correlation between the Abaqus predictions and
the experimental data. You can evaluate the hyperelastic behavior automatically in Abaqus/CAE. Alternatively,
single-element test cases can be used to derive the nominal stress–nominal strain response of the material model.
See Fitting of rubber test data, which illustrates the entire process of ﬁtting hyperelastic constants to a set of
test data.

Hyperelastic Material Stability
An important consideration in judging the quality of the ﬁt to experimental data is the concept of material or
Drucker stability. Abaqus checks the Drucker stability of the material for the ﬁrst three deformation modes
described above.
The Drucker stability condition for an incompressible material requires that the change in the stress, 
, following
from any inﬁnitesimal change in the logarithmic strain, 
, satisﬁes the inequality
Using 
, where 
 is the tangent material stiffness, the inequality becomes
thus requiring the tangential material stiffness to be positive-deﬁnite.
For an isotropic elastic formulation the inequality can be represented in terms of the principal stresses and strains,
As before, since the material is assumed to be incompressible, we can choose any value for the hydrostatic
pressure without affecting the strains. A convenient choice for the stability calculation is 
, which
allows us to ignore the third term in the above equation.
The relation between the changes in stress and in strain can then be obtained in the form of the matrix
where 
. For material stability 
 must be positive-deﬁnite; thus, it is necessary that
This stability check is performed for the polynomial models, the Ogden potential, the Van der Waals form, the
Marlow form, and the Valanis-Landel form. The Arruda-Boyce form is always stable for positive values of ( ,
); hence, it sufﬁces to check the material coefﬁcients to ensure stability.
You should be careful when deﬁning the 
 or 
 for the polynomial models or the Ogden form: especially
when 
, the behavior at higher strains is strongly sensitive to the values of the 
 or 
, and unstable
material behavior may result if these values are not deﬁned correctly. When some of the coefﬁcients are strongly
negative, instability at higher strain levels is likely to occur.
Abaqus performs a check on the stability of the material for six different forms of loading—uniaxial tension and
compression, equibiaxial tension and compression, and planar tension and compression—for 
(nominal strain range of 
) at intervals 
. If an instability is found, Abaqus issues a
warning message and prints the lowest absolute value of 
 for which the instability is observed. Ideally, no
instability occurs. If instabilities are observed at strain levels that are likely to occur in the analysis, it is strongly
recommended that you either change the material model or carefully examine and revise the material input data.
If user subroutine UHYPER, user subroutine UHYPER_STRETCH or VUHYPERis used to deﬁne the hyperelastic
material, you are responsible for ensuring stability.

Improving the Accuracy and Stability of the Test Data Fit
Unfortunately, the initial ﬁt of the models to experimental data might not come out as well as expected. This is
particularly true for the most general models, such as the (general) polynomial model and the Ogden model. For
some of the simpler models, stability is assured by following some simple rules.
•
For positive values of the initial shear modulus, , and the locking stretch, 
, the Arruda-Boyce form is
always stable.
•
For positive values of the coefﬁcient 
 the neo-Hookean form is always stable.
•
Given positive values of the initial shear modulus, , and the locking stretch, 
, the stability of the Van
der Waals model depends on the global interaction parameter, a.
•
For the Yeoh model stability is assured if all 
. Typically, however, 
 will be negative, since this
helps capture the S-shape feature of the stress-strain curve. Thus, reducing the absolute value of 
 or
magnifying the absolute value of 
 will help make the Yeoh model more stable.
In all cases the following suggestions might improve the quality of the ﬁt:
•
Both tension and compression data are allowed; compressive stresses and strains are entered as negative
values. Use compression or tension data depending on the application: it is difﬁcult to ﬁt a single material
model accurately to both tensile and compressive data.
•
Always use many more experimental data points than unknown coefﬁcients.
•
If 
 is used, experimental data should be available to at least 100% tensile strain or 50% compressive
strain.
•
Perform different types of tests (e.g., compression and simple shear tests). Proper material behavior for a
deformation mode requires test data to characterize that mode.
•
Check for warning messages about material instability or error messages about lack of convergence in ﬁtting
the test data. This check is especially important with new test data; a simple ﬁnite element model with the
new test data can be run through the analysis input ﬁle processor to check the material stability.
•
Use the material evaluation capability in Abaqus/CAE to compare the response curves for different strain
energy potentials to the experimental data. Alternatively, you can perform one-element simulations for simple
deformation modes and compare the Abaqus results against the experimental data. The X–Y plotting options
in the Visualization module of Abaqus/CAE can be used for this comparison.
•
Delete some data points at very low strains if large strains are anticipated. A disproportionate number of low
strain points might unnecessarily bias the accuracy of the ﬁt toward the low strain range and cause greater
errors in the large strain range.
•
Delete some data points at the highest strains if small to moderate strains are expected. The high strain points
might force the ﬁtting to lose accuracy and/or stability in the low strain range.
•
Pick data points at evenly spaced strain intervals over the expected range of strains, which will result in
similar accuracy throughout the entire strain range.
•
The higher the order of N, the more oscillations are likely to occur, leading to instabilities in the stress-strain
curves. If the (general) polynomial model is used, lower the order of N from 2 to 1 (3 to 2 for Ogden),
especially if the maximum strain level is low (say, less than 100% strain).
•
If multiple types of test data are used and the ﬁt still comes out poorly, some of the test data probably contain
experimental errors. New tests might be needed. One way of determining which test data are erroneous is to
ﬁrst calibrate the initial shear modulus 
 of the material. Then ﬁt each type of test data separately in
Abaqus and compute the shear modulus, 
, from the material constants using the relations

Alternatively, the initial Young's modulus,

Elements
The hyperelastic material model can be used with solid (continuum) elements, ﬁnite-strain shells (except S4),
continuum shells, membranes, and one-dimensional elements (trusses and rebars).
In Abaqus/Standard, the hyperelastic material model can be also used with Timoshenko beams (B21, B22, B31,
B31OS, B32, B32OS, PIPE21, PIPE22, PIPE31, PIPE32, and their “hybrid” equivalents). It cannot be used with
Euler-Bernoulli beams (B23, B23H, B33, and B33H) and small-strain shells (STRI3, STRI65, S4R5, S8R, S8R5,
and S9R5).
In Abaqus/Explicit the hyperelastic material model can be also used with Timoshenko beams (B21, B22, B31,
and B32).
Pure Displacement Formulation Versus Hybrid Formulation in Abaqus/Standard
For continuum elements in Abaqus/Standard hyperelasticity can be used with the pure displacement formulation
elements or with the “hybrid” (mixed formulation) elements. Because elastomeric materials are usually almost
incompressible, fully integrated pure displacement method elements are not recommended for use with this
material, except for plane stress cases. If fully or selectively reduced-integration displacement method elements
are used with the almost incompressible form of this material model, a penalty method is used to impose the
incompressibility constraint in anything except plane stress analysis. The penalty method can sometimes lead
to numerical difﬁculties; therefore, the fully or selectively reduced-integrated “hybrid” formulation elements
are recommended for use with hyperelastic materials.
In general, an analysis using a single hybrid element will be only slightly more computationally expensive than
an analysis using a regular displacement-based element. However, when the wavefront is optimized, the Lagrange
multipliers might not be ordered independently of the regular degrees of freedom associated with the element.
Thus, the wavefront of a very large mesh of second-order hybrid tetrahedra might be noticeably larger than that
of an equivalent mesh using regular second-order tetrahedra. This might lead to signiﬁcantly higher CPU costs,
disk space, and memory requirements.
Incompatible Mode Elements in Abaqus/Standard
Incompatible mode elements should be used with caution in applications involving large strains. Convergence
might be slow, and in hyperelastic applications inaccuracies might accumulate. Erroneous stresses might sometimes
appear in incompatible mode hyperelastic elements that are unloaded after having been subjected to a complex
deformation history.
Procedures
Hyperelasticity must always be used with geometrically nonlinear analyses (General and Perturbation
Procedures).

Overview
The elastomeric foam material model:
•
is isotropic and nonlinear;
•
is valid for cellular solids whose porosity permits very large volumetric changes;
•
optionally allows the speciﬁcation of energy dissipation and stress softening effects (see Energy Dissipation in
Elastomeric Foams);
•
can deform elastically to large strains, up to 90% strain in compression; and
•
requires that geometric nonlinearity be accounted for during the analysis step (see Deﬁning an Analysis and General
and Perturbation Procedures), since it is intended for ﬁnite-strain applications.
Abaqus/Explicit also provides a separate foam material model intended to capture the strain-rate sensitive behavior of
low-density elastomeric foams such as used in crash and impact applications (see Low-Density Foams).
Mechanical Behavior of Elastomeric Foams
Cellular solids are made up of interconnected networks of solid struts or plates that form the edges and faces of
cells. Foams are made up of polyhedral cells that pack in three dimensions. The foam cells can be either open
(e.g., sponge) or closed (e.g., ﬂotation foam). Common examples of elastomeric foam materials are cellular
polymers such as cushions, padding, and packaging materials that utilize the excellent energy absorption properties
of foams: the energy absorbed by foams is substantially greater than that absorbed by ordinary stiff elastic
materials for a certain stress level.
Another class of foam materials is crushable foams, which undergo permanent (plastic) deformation. Crushable
foams are discussed in Crushable Foam Plasticity Models.
Foams are commonly loaded in compression. Figure 1 shows a typical compressive stress-strain curve.

Three stages can be distinguished during compression:
1. At small strains (  5%) the foam deforms in a linear elastic manner due to cell wall bending.
2. The next stage is a plateau of deformation at almost constant stress, caused by the elastic buckling of the
columns or plates that make up the cell edges or walls. In closed cells the enclosed gas pressure and membrane
stretching increase the level and slope of the plateau.
3. Finally, a region of densiﬁcation occurs, where the cell walls crush together, resulting in a rapid increase of
compressive stress. Ultimate compressive nominal strains of 0.7 to 0.9 are typical.
The tensile deformation mechanisms for small strains are similar to the compression mechanisms, but they differ
for large strains. Figure 2 shows a typical tensile stress-strain curve.

There are two stages during tension:

in compression.
2. The cell walls rotate and align, resulting in rising stiffness. The walls are substantially aligned at a tensile
strain of about 
. Further stretching results in increased axial strains in the walls.

Hyperelastic Behavior in Elastomeric Foams

At small strains for both compression and tension, the average experimentally observed Poisson's ratio, , of
foams is 1/3. At larger strains it is commonly observed that Poisson's ratio is effectively zero during compression:
the buckling of the cell walls does not result in any signiﬁcant lateral deformation. However,  is nonzero during
tension, which is a result of the alignment and stretching of the cell walls.
The manufacture of foams often results in cells with different principal dimensions. This shape anisotropy results
in different loading responses in different directions. However, the hyperfoam model does not take this kind of
initial anisotropy into account.

Determining the Hyperfoam Material Parameters
The response of the material is deﬁned by the parameters in the strain energy function, U; these parameters must
be determined to use the hyperfoam model. Two methods are provided for deﬁning the material parameters: you
can specify the hyperfoam material parameters directly or specify test data and allow Abaqus to calculate the
material parameters.
The elastic response of a viscoelastic material (Time Domain Viscoelasticity) can be speciﬁed by deﬁning either
the instantaneous response or the long-term response of such a material.
Instantaneous Response
To deﬁne the instantaneous response, the experiments outlined in Experimental Tests have to be performed
within time spans much shorter than the characteristic relaxation time of the material.

Test Data Specification
The value of N and the experimental stress-strain data can be speciﬁed for up to ﬁve simple tests: uniaxial,
equibiaxial, simple shear, planar, and volumetric. Abaqus contains a capability for obtaining the 
, 
, and 
for the hyperfoam model with up to six terms (N=6) directly from test data. Poisson effects can be included
either by means of a constant Poisson's ratio or through speciﬁcation of volumetric test data and/or lateral strains
in the other test data.
It is important to recognize that the properties of foam materials can vary signiﬁcantly from one batch to another.
Therefore, all of the experiments should be performed on specimens taken from the same batch of material.
This method does not allow the properties to be temperature dependent.
As many data points as required can be entered from each test. Abaqus will then compute 
, 
, and, if necessary,
. The technique uses a least squares ﬁt to the experimental data so that the relative error in the nominal stress
is minimized.
It is recommended that data from the uniaxial, biaxial, and simple shear tests (on samples taken from the same
piece of material) be included and that the data points cover the range of nominal strains expected to arise in the
actual loading. The planar and volumetric tests are optional.
For all tests the strain data, including the lateral strain data, should be given as nominal strain values (change in
length per unit of original length). For the uniaxial, equibiaxial, simple shear, and planar tests, stress data are
given as nominal stress values (force per unit of original cross-sectional area). The tests allow for both compression
and tension data; compressive stresses and strains should be entered as negative values. For the volumetric tests
the stress data are given as pressure values.
Use the ﬁrst option to deﬁne an effective Poisson's ratio (

Difference between Compression and Tension Deformation
For small strains (  5%) foams behave similarly for both compression and tension. However, at large strains
the deformation mechanisms differ for compression (buckling and crushing) and tension (alignment and stretching).
Therefore, accurate hyperfoam modeling requires that the experimental data used to deﬁne the material parameters
correspond to the dominant deformation modes of the problem being analyzed. If compression dominates, the
pertinent tests are:
•
Uniaxial compression
•
Simple shear
•
Planar compression (if Poisson's ratio 
)
•
Volumetric compression (if Poisson's ratio 
)
If tension dominates, the pertinent tests are:
•
Uniaxial tension
•
Simple shear
•
Biaxial tension (if Poisson's ratio 
)
119
Abaqus Materials Guide
Hyperelastic Behavior in Elastomeric Foams

•
Planar tension (if Poisson's ratio 
)
Lateral strain data can also be used to deﬁne the compressibility of the foam. Measurement of the lateral strains
may make other tests redundant; for example, providing lateral strains for a uniaxial test eliminates the need for
a volumetric test. However, if volumetric test data are provided in addition to the lateral strain data for other
tests, both the volumetric test data and the lateral strain data will be used in determining the compressibility of
the foam. The hyperfoam model may not accurately ﬁt Poisson's ratio if it varies signiﬁcantly between compression
and tension.
Model Prediction of Material Behavior Versus Experimental Data
Once the elastomeric foam constants are determined, the behavior of the hyperfoam model in Abaqus is established.
However, the quality of this behavior must be assessed: the prediction of material behavior under different
deformation modes must be compared against the experimental data. You must judge whether the elastomeric
foam constants determined by Abaqus are acceptable, based on the correlation between the Abaqus predictions
and the experimental data. Single-element test cases can be used to calculate the nominal stress–nominal strain
response of the material model.
See Fitting of elastomeric foam test data, which illustrates the entire process of ﬁtting elastomeric foam constants
to a set of test data.
Elastomeric Foam Material Stability
As with incompressible hyperelasticity, Abaqus checks the Drucker stability of the material for the deformation
modes described above. The Drucker stability condition for a compressible material requires that the change in
the Kirchhoff stress, 
, following from an inﬁnitesimal change in the logarithmic strain, 
, satisﬁes the
inequality
where the Kirchhoff stress 
. Using 
, the inequality becomes
This restriction requires that the tangential material stiffness 
 be positive deﬁnite.
For an isotropic elastic formulation the inequality can be represented in terms of the principal stresses and strains
Thus, the relation between changes in the stress and changes in the strain can be obtained in the form of the
matrix equation
where 
Since 
 must be positive deﬁnite, it is necessary that

You should be careful about deﬁning the parameters 
, 
, and 
: especially when 
, the behavior at
higher strains is strongly sensitive to the values of these parameters, and unstable material behavior may result
if these values are not deﬁned correctly. When some of the coefﬁcients are strongly negative, instability at higher
strain levels is likely to occur. Abaqus performs a check on the stability of the material for nine different forms
of loading—uniaxial tension and compression, equibiaxial tension and compression, simple shear, planar tension
and compression, and volumetric tension and compression—for 
 (nominal strain range of
), at intervals 
. If an instability is found, Abaqus issues a warning message and
prints the lowest absolute value of 
 for which the instability is observed. Ideally, no instability occurs. If
instabilities are observed at strain levels that are likely to occur in the analysis, it is strongly recommended that
you carefully examine and revise the material input data.
Improving the Accuracy and Stability of the Test Data Fit
Hyperelastic Behavior of Rubberlike Materials contains suggestions for improving the accuracy and stability of
elastomeric modeling. Fitting of elastomeric foam test data illustrates the process of ﬁtting elastomeric foam
test data.
Elements
The hyperfoam model can be used with solid (continuum) elements, ﬁnite-strain shells (except S4), and
membranes. However, it cannot be used with one-dimensional solid elements (trusses and beams), small-strain
shells (STRI3, STRI65, S4R5, S8R, S8R5, S9R5), or the Eulerian elements (EC3D8R and EC3D8RT).
For continuum elements elastomeric foam hyperelasticity can be used with pure displacement formulation
elements or, in Abaqus/Standard, with the “hybrid” (mixed formulation) elements. Since elastomeric foams are
assumed to be very compressible, the use of hybrid elements will generally not yield any advantage over the use
of purely displacement-based elements.
Procedures
The hyperfoam model must always be used with geometrically nonlinear analyses (General and Perturbation
Procedures).

Overview
The anisotropic hyperelastic material model:
•
provides a general capability for modeling materials that exhibit highly anisotropic and nonlinear elastic behavior
(such as biomedical soft tissues and ﬁber-reinforced elastomers);
•
can be used in combination with large-strain time-domain viscoelasticity (Time Domain Viscoelasticity); however,
viscoelasticity is isotropic;
•
optionally allows the speciﬁcation of energy dissipation and stress softening effects (see Mullins Effect); and
•
requires that geometric nonlinearity be accounted for during the analysis step (General and Perturbation Procedures)
since it is intended for ﬁnite-strain applications.
Anisotropic Hyperelasticity Formulations
Many materials of industrial and technological interest exhibit anisotropic elastic behavior due to the presence
of preferred directions in their microstructure. Examples of such materials include common engineering materials
(such as ﬁber-reinforced composites, reinforced rubber, and wood) as well as soft biological tissues (arterial
walls, heart tissue, etc.). When these materials are subjected to small deformations (less than 2–5%), their
mechanical behavior can generally be modeled adequately using conventional anisotropic linear elasticity ( see
Deﬁning Fully Anisotropic Elasticity). Under large deformations, however, these materials exhibit highly
anisotropic and nonlinear elastic behavior due to rearrangements in the microstructure, such as reorientation of
the ﬁber directions with deformation. The simulation of these nonlinear large-strain effects calls for more
advanced constitutive models formulated within the framework of anisotropic hyperelasticity. Hyperelastic
materials are described in terms of a “strain energy potential,” , which deﬁnes the strain energy stored in the
material per unit of reference volume (volume in the initial conﬁguration) as a function of the deformation at
that point in the material. Two distinct formulations are used for the representation of the strain energy potential
of anisotropic hyperelastic materials: strain-based and invariant-based.
Strain-Based Formulation
In this case the strain energy function is expressed directly in terms of the components of a suitable strain tensor,
such as the Green strain tensor (see Strain measures):
Abaqus Materials Guide
122
Anisotropic Hyperelastic Behavior

where 
 is Green's strain; 
 is the right Cauchy-Green strain tensor;  is the deformation
gradient; and  is the identity matrix. Without loss of generality, the strain energy function can be written in the
form
where 
 is the modiﬁed Green strain tensor; 
 is the distortional part of the right
Cauchy-Green strain; 
 is the total volume change; and 
 is the elastic volume ratio as deﬁned
below in Thermal Expansion.
The underlying assumption in models based on the strain-based formulation is that the preferred material directions
are initially aligned with an orthogonal coordinate system in the reference (stress-free) conﬁguration. These
directions might become nonorthogonal only after deformation. Examples of this form of strain energy function
include the generalized Fung-type form described below.
Invariant-Based Formulation
Using the continuum theory of ﬁber-reinforced composites (Spencer, 1984) the strain energy function can be
expressed directly in terms of the invariants of the deformation tensor and ﬁber directions. For example, consider
a composite material that consists of an isotropic hyperelastic matrix reinforced with 
 families of ﬁbers. The
directions of the ﬁbers in the reference conﬁguration are characterized by a set of unit vectors 
, (
).
Assuming that the strain energy depends not only on deformation, but also on the ﬁber directions, the following
form is postulated
The strain energy of the material must remain unchanged if both matrix and ﬁbers in the reference conﬁguration
undergo a rigid body rotation. Then, following Spencer (1984), the strain energy can be expressed in terms of
an irreducible set of scalar invariants that form the integrity basis of the tensor 
 and the vectors 
:
where 
 and 
 are the ﬁrst and second deviatoric strain invariants; 
 is the elastic volume ratio (or third
strain invariant); 
 and 
 are the pseudo-invariants of 
, 
; and 
, deﬁned as:
The terms 
 are geometric constants (independent of deformation) equal to the cosine of the angle between
the directions of any two families of ﬁbers in the reference conﬁguration:
Unlike for the case of the strain-based formulation, in the invariant-based formulation the ﬁber directions need
not be orthogonal in the initial conﬁguration. An example of an invariant-based energy function is the form
proposed by Holzapfel, Gasser, and Ogden (2000) for arterial walls (see Holzapfel-Gasser-Ogden Form below).
Anisotropic Strain Energy Potentials
There are four forms of strain energy potentials available in Abaqus to model approximately incompressible
anisotropic materials:
•
the generalized Fung form (including fully anisotropic and orthotropic cases),
•
the Holzapfel-Gasser-Ogden form for arterial walls,
123
Abaqus Materials Guide
Anisotropic Hyperelastic Behavior

•
the Holzapfel-Ogden form for passive myocardium tissue, and
•
the Kaliske-Schmidt form for reinforced polymeric materials and biomaterials.
These forms are adequate for modeling soft biological tissue. However, whereas Fung's form is purely

In addition, Abaqus provides a general capability to support user-deﬁned forms of the strain energy potential
via two sets of user subroutines: one for strain-based and one for invariant-based formulations.
Generalized Fung Form
The generalized Fung strain energy potential has the following form:
where U is the strain energy per unit of reference volume;  and D are temperature-dependent material parameters;
 is the elastic volume ratio as deﬁned below in Thermal Expansion; and  is deﬁned as
where 
 is a dimensionless symmetric fourth-order tensor of anisotropic material constants that can be
temperature dependent and 
 are the components of the modiﬁed Green strain tensor.
The initial deviatoric elasticity tensor, 
, and bulk modulus, 
, are given by
Abaqus supports two forms of the generalized Fung model: fully anisotropic and orthotropic. The number of
independent components 
 that must be speciﬁed depends on the level of anisotropy of the material: 21 for
the fully anisotropic case and 9 for the orthotropic case.

The model assumes that the directions of the collagen ﬁbers within each family are dispersed (with rotational
symmetry) about a mean preferred direction. The parameter  (

in the ﬁber directions. If

the normalized number of ﬁbers with orientations in the range 
 with respect to the mean direction),
the parameter  is deﬁned as
It is also assumed that all families of ﬁbers have the same mechanical properties and the same dispersion. When
 the ﬁbers are perfectly aligned (no dispersion). When 
 the ﬁbers are randomly distributed and
the material becomes isotropic; this corresponds to a spherical orientation density function.

The ﬁrst two terms in the expression of the strain energy function represent the distortional and volumetric
contributions of the noncollagenous isotropic ground material, and the third term represents the contributions
from the different families of collagen ﬁbers, taking into account the effects of dispersion. A basic assumption
of the model is that collagen ﬁbers can support tension only, because they would buckle under compressive
loading. Thus, the anisotropic contribution in the strain energy function appears only when the strain of the ﬁbers
is positive or, equivalently, when

Linearization of Holzapfel-Ogden Strain Energy Potential

energy potential might overﬂow numerically. To avoid this, the exponential terms can be linearized/approximated
by polynomial functions when the stretch in the ﬁber direction reaches a certain value

Definition of Preferred Material Directions
You must deﬁne the preferred material directions (or ﬁber directions) of the anisotropic hyperelastic material.
For strain-based forms (such as the Fung form and user-deﬁned forms using user subroutines
UANISOHYPER_STRAIN or VUANISOHYPER_STRAIN), you must specify a local orientation system
(Orientations) to deﬁne the directions of anisotropy. Components of the modiﬁed Green strain tensor are calculated
with respect to this system.
For invariant-based forms of the strain energy function (such as the Holzapfel-Gasser-Ogden form, the
Holzapfel-Ogden form, the Kaliske-Schmidt form, and user-deﬁned forms using user subroutines
UANISOHYPER_INV or VUANISOHYPER_INV), you must specify the local direction vectors, 
, that
Abaqus Materials Guide
128
Anisotropic Hyperelastic Behavior

characterize each family of ﬁbers. These vectors need not be orthogonal in the initial conﬁguration. Up to three
local directions can be speciﬁed as part of the deﬁnition of a local orientation system (Deﬁning a Local Coordinate
System Directly); the local directions are referred to this system.
In Abaqus/CAE, the local direction vectors of the material are orthogonal and align with the axes of the assigned
material orientation. The best practice is to assign the orientation using discrete orientations in Abaqus/CAE.
Material directions can be output to the output database as described in Output below.
Compressibility
Most soft tissues and ﬁber-reinforced elastomers have very little compressibility compared to their shear ﬂexibility.
This behavior does not warrant special attention for plane stress, shell, or membrane elements, but the numerical
solution can be quite sensitive to the degree of compressibility for three-dimensional solid, plane strain, and
axisymmetric elements. In cases where the material is highly conﬁned (such as an O-ring used as a seal), the
compressibility must be modeled correctly to obtain accurate results. In applications where the material is not
highly conﬁned, the degree of compressibility is typically not crucial; for example, it would be quite satisfactory
in Abaqus/Standard to assume that the material is fully incompressible: the volume of the material cannot change
except for thermal expansion.
Compressibility in Abaqus/Standard
In Abaqus/Standard the use of “hybrid” (mixed formulation) elements is required for incompressible materials.
In plane stress, shell, and membrane elements the material is free to deform in the thickness direction. In this
case special treatment of the volumetric behavior is not necessary; the use of regular stress/displacement elements
is satisfactory.
Compressibility in Abaqus/Explicit
With the exception of the plane stress and one-dimensional cases, it is not possible to assume that the material
is fully incompressible in Abaqus/Explicit because the program has no mechanism for imposing such a constraint
at each material calculation point. Instead, some compressibility must be modeled. The difﬁculty is that, in many
cases, the actual material behavior provides too little compressibility for the algorithms to work efﬁciently. Thus,
except for the plane stress case, you must provide enough compressibility for the code to work, knowing that
this makes the bulk behavior of the model softer than that of the actual material. Failing to provide enough
compressibility might introduce high frequency noise into the dynamic solution and require the use of excessively
small time increments. Some judgment is, therefore, required to decide whether or not the solution is sufﬁciently
accurate or whether the problem can be modeled at all with Abaqus/Explicit because of this numerical limitation.
If no value is given for the material compressibility of the anisotropic hyperelastic model, by default
Abaqus/Explicit assumes the value 
, where 
 is the largest value of the initial shear modulus
(among the different material directions). The exception is for the case of user-deﬁned forms, where some
compressibility must be deﬁned directly within user subroutine UANISOHYPER_INV or VUANISOHYPER_INV.
Thermal Expansion
Both isotropic and orthotropic thermal expansion is permitted with the anisotropic hyperelastic material model.
The elastic volume ratio,

:

where 
 are the principal thermal expansion strains that are obtained from the temperature and the thermal
expansion coefﬁcients (Thermal Expansion).
Viscoelasticity
Anisotropic hyperelastic models can be used in combination with isotropic viscoelasticity to model rate-dependent
material behavior (Time Domain Viscoelasticity). Because of the isotropy of viscoelasticity, the relaxation
function is independent of the loading direction. This assumption might not be acceptable for modeling materials
that exhibit strong anisotropy in their rate-dependent behavior; therefore, this option should be used with caution.
The anisotropic hyperelastic response of rate-dependent materials (Time Domain Viscoelasticity) can be speciﬁed
by deﬁning either the instantaneous response or the long-term response of such materials.
Use either of the following options:

Abaqus/CAE Usage:
Stress Softening
The response of typical anisotropic hyperelastic materials, such as reinforced rubbers and biological tissues,
under cyclic loading and unloading usually displays stress softening effects during the ﬁrst few cycles. After a
few cycles the response of the material tends to stabilize and the material is said to be preconditioned. Stress
softening effects, often referred to in the elastomers literature as Mullins effect, can be accounted for by using
the anisotropic hyperelastic model in combination with the pseudo-elasticity model for Mullins effect in Abaqus
(see Mullins Effect). The stress softening effects provided by this model are isotropic.
Elements
The anisotropic hyperelastic material model can be used with solid (continuum) elements, ﬁnite-strain shells
(except S4), continuum shells, and membranes. When used in combination with elements with plane stress
formulations, Abaqus assumes fully incompressible behavior and ignores any amount of compressibility speciﬁed
for the material.
The invariant-based anisotropic hyperelastic material model is also available with one-dimensional elements
(trusses and rebars) in Abaqus/Explicit. In this case, Abaqus/Explicit assumes fully incompressible material
behavior.
Pure Displacement Formulation Versus Hybrid Formulation in Abaqus/Standard
For continuum elements in Abaqus/Standard anisotropic hyperelasticity can be used with the pure displacement
formulation elements or with the “hybrid” (mixed formulation) elements. Pure displacement formulation elements
must be used with compressible materials, and “hybrid” (mixed formulation) elements must be used with
incompressible materials.
In general, an analysis using a single hybrid element is only slightly more computationally expensive than an
analysis using a regular displacement-based element. However, when the wavefront is optimized, the Lagrange
multipliers might not be ordered independently of the regular degrees of freedom associated with the element.
Thus, the wavefront of a very large mesh of second-order hybrid tetrahedra might be noticeably larger than that
Abaqus Materials Guide
130
Anisotropic Hyperelastic Behavior

of an equivalent mesh using regular second-order tetrahedra. This might lead to signiﬁcantly higher CPU costs,
disk space, and memory requirements.
Incompatible Mode Elements in Abaqus/Standard
Incompatible mode elements should be used with caution in applications involving large strains. Convergence
might be slow, and in hyperelastic applications inaccuracies might accumulate. Erroneous stresses might sometimes
appear in incompatible mode anisotropic hyperelastic elements that are unloaded after having been subjected to
a complex deformation history.
Procedures
Anisotropic hyperelasticity must always be used with geometrically nonlinear analyses (General and Perturbation
Procedures).
Output
In addition to the standard output identiﬁers available in Abaqus (Abaqus/Standard Output Variable Identiﬁers
and Abaqus/Explicit Output Variable Identiﬁers), local material directions are output whenever element ﬁeld
output is requested to the output database. The local directions are output as ﬁeld variables (LOCALDIR1,
LOCALDIR2, LOCALDIR3) representing the direction cosines; these variables can be visualized as vector plots
in the Visualization module of Abaqus/CAE (Abaqus/Viewer).
Output of local material directions is suppressed if no element ﬁeld output is requested or if you specify not to
have element material directions written to the output database (see Specifying the Directions for Element Output).

Overview
The Mullins effect model:
•
provides an extension to the well-known isotropic hyperelastic models;
•
is based on the theory of incompressible isotropic elasticity modiﬁed by the addition of a single variable, referred
to as the damage variable;
•
assumes that only the deviatoric part of the material response is associated with damage;
•
is intended for modeling material response in situations where different parts of the model undergo different levels
of damage resulting in a different material response;
•
is applied to the long-term modulus when combined with viscoelasticity; and
•
cannot be used with hysteresis.
Abaqus provides a similar capability that can be applied to elastomeric foams (see Energy Dissipation in Elastomeric
Foams).
Material Behavior
The real behavior of ﬁlled rubber elastomers under cyclic loading conditions is quite complex. Certain idealizations
have been made for modeling purposes. In essence, these idealizations result in two main components to the
material behavior: the ﬁrst component describes the response of a material point (from an undeformed state)
under monotonic straining, and the second component is associated with damage and describes the
unloading-reloading behavior. The idealized response and the two components are described in the following
sections.

Mullins Effect

Idealized Material Behavior
When an elastomeric test specimen is subjected to simple tension from its virgin state, unloaded, and then
reloaded, the stress required on reloading is less than that on the initial loading for stretches up to the maximum
stretch achieved during the initial loading. This stress softening phenomenon is known as the Mullins effect and
reﬂects damage incurred during previous loading. This type of material response is depicted qualitatively in
Figure 1.

Figure 1: Idealized response of the Mullins effect model.
This ﬁgure and the accompanying description is based on work by Ogden and Roxburgh (1999), which forms
the basis of the model implemented in Abaqus. Consider the primary loading path 
 of a previously unstressed
material, with loading to an arbitrary point . On unloading from , the path 
 is followed. When the material
is loaded again, the softened path is retraced as 
. If further loading is then applied, the path 
 is followed,
where 
 is a continuation of the primary loading path 
 (which is the path that would be followed if
there was no unloading). If loading is now stopped at , the path 
 is followed on unloading and then retraced
back to  on reloading. If no further loading beyond  is applied, the curve 
 represents the subsequent
material response, which is then elastic. For loading beyond , the primary path is again followed and the pattern
described is repeated.
This is an ideal representation of Mullins effect since in practice there is some permanent set upon unloading
and/or viscoelastic effects such as hysteresis. Points such as  and  might not exist in reality in the sense that
unloading from the primary curve followed by reloading to the maximum strain level attained earlier usually
results in a stress that is somewhat lower than the stress corresponding to the primary curve. In addition, the
cyclic response for some ﬁlled elastomers shows evidence of progressive damage during unloading from and
subsequent reloading to a certain maximum strain level. Such progressive damage usually occurs during the ﬁrst
few cycles, and the material behavior soon stabilizes to a loading/unloading cycle that is followed beyond the
ﬁrst few cycles. More details regarding the actual behavior and how test data that display such behavior can be
used to calibrate the Abaqus model for Mullins effect are discussed later and in Analysis of a solid disc with
Mullins effect and permanent set.
The loading path 
 will henceforth be referred to as the “primary hyperelastic behavior.” The primary
hyperelastic behavior is deﬁned by using a hyperelastic material model.
Abaqus Materials Guide
134
Mullins Effect

Stress softening is interpreted as being due to damage at the microscopic level. As the material is loaded, the
damage occurs by the severing of bonds between ﬁller particles and the rubber molecular chains. Different chain
links break at different deformation levels, thereby leading to continuous damage with macroscopic deformation.
An equivalent interpretation is that the energy required to cause the damage is not recoverable.
Primary Hyperelastic Behavior
Hyperelastic materials are described in terms of a “strain energy potential” function 
 that deﬁnes the strain
energy stored in the material per unit reference volume (volume in the initial conﬁguration). The quantity  is
the deformation gradient tensor. To account for Mullins effect, Ogden and Roxburgh propose a material description
that is based on an energy function of the form 
, where the additional scalar variable, , represents
damage in the material. The damage variable controls the material properties in the sense that it enables the
material response to be governed by an energy function on unloading and subsequent submaximal reloading
different from that on the primary (initial) loading path from a virgin state. Because of the above interpretation
of , it is no longer appropriate to think of U as the stored elastic energy potential. Part of the energy is stored
as strain energy, while the rest is dissipated due to damage. The shaded area in Figure 1 represents the energy
dissipated by damage as a result of deformation until the point , while the unshaded part represents the
recoverable strain energy.
The following paragraphs provide a summary of the Mullins effect model in Abaqus. For further details, see
Mullins effect. In preparation for writing the constitutive equations for Mullins effect, it is useful to separate the
deviatoric and the volumetric parts of the total strain energy density as
In the above equation U, 
, and 
 are the total, deviatoric, and volumetric parts of the strain energy density,
respectively. All the hyperelasticity models in Abaqus use strain energy potential functions that are already
separated into deviatoric and volumetric parts. For example, the polynomial models use a strain energy potential
of the form
where the symbols have the usual interpretations. The ﬁrst term on the right represents the deviatoric part of the
elastic strain energy density function, and the second term represents the volumetric part.
Modified Strain Energy Density Function
The Mullins effect is accounted for by using an augmented energy function of the form
where 
 is the deviatoric part of the strain energy density of the primary hyperelastic behavior, deﬁned,
for example, by the ﬁrst term on the right-hand-side of the polynomial strain energy function given above;
 is the volumetric part of the strain energy density, deﬁned, for example, by the second term on the
right-hand-side of the polynomial strain energy function given above; 
 represent the deviatoric
principal stretches; and 
 represents the elastic volume ratio. The function 
 is a continuous function of
the damage variable  and is referred to as the “damage function.” When the deformation state of the material
is on a point on the curve that represents the primary hyperelastic behavior, 
, 
,
, and the augmented energy function reduces to the strain energy density
function of the primary hyperelastic behavior. The damage variable varies continuously during the course of the

Abaqus Materials Guide
Mullins Effect

deformation and always satisﬁes 
. The above form of the energy function is an extension of the form
proposed by Ogden and Roxburgh to account for material compressibility.
Stress Computation
With the above modiﬁcation to the energy function, the stresses are given by
where  is the deviatoric stress corresponding to the primary hyperelastic behavior at the current deviatoric
deformation level 
 and  is the hydrostatic pressure of the primary hyperelastic behavior at the current
volumetric deformation level 
. Thus, the deviatoric stress as a result of Mullins effect is obtained by simply
scaling the deviatoric stress of the primary hyperelastic behavior with the damage variable . The pressure stress
is the same as that of the primary behavior. The model predicts loading/unloading along a single curve (that is
different, in general, from the primary hyperelastic behavior) from any given strain level that passes through the
origin of the stress-strain plot. It cannot capture permanent strains upon removal of load. The model also predicts
that a purely volumetric deformation will not have any damage or Mullins effect associated with it.
Damage Variable
The damage variable, , varies with the deformation according to
where 
 is the maximum value of 
 at a material point during its deformation history; r, , and m are
material parameters; and 
 is the error function deﬁned as
When 
, corresponding to a point on the primary curve, 
. However,  attains its minimum
value, 
, given by
upon removal of deformation, when 
. For all intermediate values of 
,  varies monotonically
between 
 and 
. While the parameters r and  are dimensionless, the parameter m has units of energy density
(i.e., energy per unit volume), which is equivalent to stress units. The equation for  reduces to that proposed
by Ogden and Roxburgh when 
. The material parameters can be speciﬁed directly or can be computed by
Abaqus based on curve-ﬁtting of unloading-reloading test data. These parameters are subject to the restrictions
, 
, and 
 (the parameters  and m cannot both be zero). Alternatively, the damage variable 
can be deﬁned through user subroutine UMULLINS in Abaqus/Standard and VUMULLINS in Abaqus/Explicit.
If the parameter 
 and the parameter m has a value that is small compared to 
, the slope of the stress-strain
curve at the initiation of unloading from relatively large strain levels might become very high. As a result, the
response might become discontinuous, as illustrated in Figure 2.

This kind of behavior might lead to convergence problems in Abaqus/Standard. In Abaqus/Explicit the high
stiffness will lead to very small stable time increments, thereby leading to a degradation in performance. This
problem can be avoided by choosing a small value for . The choice 
 can be used to deﬁne the original
Ogden-Roxburgh model. In Abaqus/Standard the default value of  is 0. In Abaqus/Explicit, however, the default
value of  is 0.1. Thus, if you do not specify a value for , it is assumed to be 0 in Abaqus/Standard and 0.1 in
Abaqus/Explicit.
The parameters r, , and m do not have direct physical interpretations in general. The parameter m controls
whether damage occurs at low strain levels. If 
, there is a signiﬁcant amount of damage at low strain
levels. On the other hand, a nonzero m leads to little or no damage at low strain levels. For further discussion
regarding the implications of this model to the energy dissipation, see Mullins effect. The qualitative effects of
varying the parameters r and  individually, while holding the other parameters ﬁxed, are shown in Figure 3.

The left ﬁgure shows the unloading-reloading curve from a certain maximum strain level for increasing values

This behavior follows from the fact that the larger the value of r, the less the damage variable  can deviate from
unity. The ﬁgure on the right shows the unloading-reloading curve from a certain maximum strain level for

Specifying the Mullins Effect Material Model in Abaqus
The primary hyperelastic behavior is deﬁned by using the hyperelastic material model (see Hyperelastic Behavior
of Rubberlike Materials). The Mullins effect model can be deﬁned by specifying the Mullins effect parameters
directly or by using test data to calibrate the parameters. Alternatively, you can deﬁne the Mullins effect model
with user subroutine UMULLINS in Abaqus/Standard and VUMULLINS in Abaqus/Explicit.
Specifying the Parameters Directly
The parameters r, m, and  of the Mullins effect can be given directly as functions of temperature and/or ﬁeld
variables.

Using Test Data to Calibrate the Parameters
Experimental unloading-reloading data from different strain levels can be speciﬁed for up to three simple tests:
uniaxial, biaxial, and planar. Abaqus will then compute the material parameters using a nonlinear least-squares
curve ﬁtting algorithm. It is generally best to obtain data from several experiments involving different kinds of
deformation over the range of strains of interest in the actual application and to use all these data to determine
the parameters. It is also important to obtain a good curve-ﬁt for the primary hyperelastic behavior if the primary
behavior is deﬁned using test data.
By default, Abaqus attempts to ﬁt all three parameters to the given data. This is possible in general, except in
the situation when the test data correspond to unloading-reloading from only a single value of 
. In this case
the parameters m and  cannot be determined independently; one of them must be speciﬁed. If you specify
neither m nor , Abaqus needs to assume a default value for one of these parameters. In light of the potential
problems discussed earlier with 
, Abaqus assumes that 
 in the above situation. The curve-ﬁtting can
also be carried out by specifying any one or two of the material parameters to be ﬁxed, predetermined values.
As many data points as required can be entered from each test. It is recommended that data from all three tests
(on samples taken from the same piece of material) be included and that the data points cover unloading/reloading
from/to the range of nominal strain expected to arise in the actual loading.
The strain data should be given as nominal strain values (change in length per unit of original length). The stress
data should be given as nominal stress values (force per unit of original cross-sectional area). These tests allow
for entering both compression and tension data. Compressive stresses and strains are entered as negative values.
For each set of test input, the data point with the maximum nominal strain identiﬁes the point of unloading. This
point is used by the curve-ﬁtting algorithm to compute 
 for that curve.
Figure 4 shows some typical unloading-reloading data from three different strain levels.
Abaqus Materials Guide
138
Mullins Effect

Nominal Stress
Nominal Strain
Figure 4:Typical available test data for Mullins effect.
The data include multiple loading and unloading cycles from each strain level. As Figure 4 indicates, the
loading/unloading cycles from any given strain level do not occur along a single curve, and there is some amount
of hysteresis. There is also some amount of permanent set upon removal of the applied load. The data also show
evidence of progressive damage with repeated cycling at any given maximum strain level. The response appears
to stabilize after a number of cycles. When such data are used to calibrate the Mullins effect model, the resulting
response will capture the overall stiffness characteristics, while ignoring effects such as hysteresis, permanent
set, or progressive damage. The above data can be provided to Abaqus in the following manner:
•
The primary curve can be made up of the data points indicated by the dashed curve in Figure 4. Essentially,
this consists of an envelope of the ﬁrst loading curves to the different strain levels.
•
The unloading-reloading curves from the three different strain levels can be speciﬁed by providing the data
points as is; i.e., as the repeated unloading-reloading cycles shown in Figure 4. As discussed earlier, the data
from the different strain levels need to be distinguished by providing them as different tables. For example,
assuming that the test data correspond to the uniaxial tension state, three tables of uniaxial test data would
have to be deﬁned for the three different strain levels shown in Figure 4. In this case Abaqus will provide a
best ﬁt using all the data points (from all strain levels). The resulting ﬁt would result in a response that is an
average of all the test data at any given strain level. While permanent set can be modeled (see Permanent
Set in Rubberlike Materials), hysteresis will be lost in the process.
•
Alternatively, you can provide any one unloading-reloading cycle from each different strain level. If the
component is expected to undergo repeated cyclic loading, the latter might be, for example, the stabilized
cycle at each strain level. On the other hand, if the component is expected to undergo predominantly monotonic
loading with perhaps small amounts of unloading, the very ﬁrst unloading curve at each strain level might
be the appropriate input data for calibrating the Mullins coefﬁcients.
Once the Mullins effect constants are determined, the behavior of the Mullins effect model in Abaqus is
established. However, the quality of this behavior must be assessed: the prediction of material behavior under
different deformation modes must be compared against the experimental data. You must judge whether the
Mullins effect constants determined by Abaqus are acceptable, based on the correlation between the Abaqus
predictions and the experimental data. Single-element test cases can be used to derive the nominal stress–nominal
strain response of the material model.
The steps that can be taken for improving the quality of the ﬁt for the Mullins effect parameters are similar in
essence to the guidelines provided for curve ﬁtting the primary hyperelastic behavior (see Hyperelastic Behavior
of Rubberlike Materials for details). In addition, the quality of the ﬁt for the Mullins effect parameters depends
on a good ﬁt for the primary hyperelastic behavior, if the primary behavior is deﬁned using test data.
139
Abaqus Materials Guide
Mullins Effect

The quality of the ﬁt can be evaluated by carrying out a numerical experiment with a single element that is loaded
in the same mode for which test data has been provided. Alternatively, the numerical response for both the
primary and the softening behavior can be obtained by requesting model deﬁnition data output (see About Output)
and carrying out a data check analysis. The response computed by Abaqus is printed in the data (.dat) ﬁle
along with the experimental data. This tabular data can be plotted in Abaqus/CAE for comparison and evaluation
purposes. The primary hyperelastic behavior can also be evaluated with the automated material evaluation tools

User Subroutine Specification
An alternative method for deﬁning the Mullins effect involves deﬁning the damage variable in user subroutine
UMULLINS in Abaqus/Standard and VUMULLINS in Abaqus/Explicit. Optionally, you can specify the number
of property values needed as data in the user subroutine. You must provide the damage variable, , and its
derivative, 
. The latter contributes to the Jacobian of the overall system of equations and is necessary to
ensure good convergence characteristics in Abaqus/Standard. If needed, you can specify the number of
solution-dependent variables (About User Subroutines and Utilities). These solution-dependent variables can
be updated in the user subroutine. The damage dissipation energy and the recoverable part of the energy can
also be deﬁned for output purposes.
User subroutines UMULLINS and VUMULLINS can be used in combination with all hyperelastic potentials in

Viscoelasticity
When viscoelasticity is used in combination with Mullins effect, stress softening is applied to the long-term
behavior.
In this case speciﬁcation of the parameter 
 should be done carefully. If the underlying hyperelastic behavior
is deﬁned with an instantaneous modulus, 
 will be interpreted to be instantaneous. Otherwise, 
 is considered
to be long term. The parameter 
 has units of energy density (i.e., energy per unit volume), which is equivalent
to stress units.
Elements
The Mullins effect material model can be used with all element types that support the use of the hyperelastic
material model.
Procedures
The Mullins effect material model can be used in all procedure types that support the use of the hyperelastic
material model. In linear perturbation steps in Abaqus/Standard the current material tangent stiffness is used to
determine the response. Speciﬁcally, when a linear perturbation is carried out about a base state that is on the
primary curve, the unloading tangent stiffness will be used.
In Abaqus/Explicit the unloading tangent stiffness is always used to compute the stable time increment. As a
result, the inclusion of Mullins effect leads to more increments in the analysis, even when no unloading actually
takes place.
The Mullins effect material model can also be used in a steady-state transport analysis in Abaqus/Standard to
obtain steady-state rolling solutions. Issues related to the use of the Mullins effect in a steady-state transport
analysis can be found in Steady-State Transport Analysis and Analysis of a solid disc with Mullins effect and
permanent set.

ESEDEN
The damage energy dissipation, represented by the shaded area in Figure 1 for deformation until , is computed
as follows. When the damaged material is in a fully unloaded state, the augmented energy function has the
residual value 
. The residual value of the energy function upon complete unloading represents
the energy dissipated due to damage in the material. The recoverable part of the energy is obtained by subtracting
the dissipated energy from the augmented energy as 
.
The damage energy accumulates with progressive deformation along the primary curve and remains constant
during unloading. During unloading, the recoverable part of the strain energy is released. The latter becomes
zero when the material point is completely unloaded. Upon further reloading from a completely unloaded state,
the recoverable part of the strain energy increases from zero. When the maximum strain that was attained earlier
is exceeded upon reloading, further accumulation of damage energy occurs.

Overview
Energy dissipation in elastomeric foams in Abaqus:
•
uses an approach based on the Mullins effect for elastomeric rubbers (Mullins Effect);
•
provides an extension to the isotropic elastomeric foam model (Hyperelastic Behavior in Elastomeric Foams);
•
is intended for modeling energy absorption in foam components subjected to dynamic loading under deformation
rates that are high compared to the characteristic relaxation time of the foam; and
•
cannot be used with viscoelasticity in Abaqus/Standard.
Energy Dissipation in Elastomeric Foams
Abaqus provides a mechanism to include permanent energy dissipation and stress softening effects in elastomeric
foams. The approach is similar to that used to model the Mullins effect in elastomeric rubbers, described in
Mullins Effect. The functionality is primarily intended for modeling energy absorption in foam components
subjected to dynamic loading under deformation rates that are high compared to the characteristic relaxation
time of the foam; in such cases it is acceptable to assume that the foam material is damaged permanently.
The material response is depicted qualitatively in Figure 1.

Consider the primary loading path 
 of a previously unstressed foam, with loading to an arbitrary point .
On unloading from , the path 
 is followed. When the material is loaded again, the softened path is retraced
as 
. If further loading is then applied, the path 
 is followed, where 
 is a continuation of the primary
loading path 
 (which is the path that would be followed if there were no unloading). If loading is now
stopped at , the path 
 is followed on unloading and then retraced back to  on reloading. If no further
loading beyond  is applied, the curve 
 represents the subsequent material response, which is then elastic.
For loading beyond , the primary path is again followed and the pattern described is repeated. The shaded area
in Figure 1 represents the energy dissipated by damage in the material for deformation until .
Modified Strain Energy Density Function
Energy dissipation effects are accounted for by introducing an augmented strain energy density function of the
form
where 
 represent the principal mechanical stretches and 
 is the strain energy potential for
the primary foam behavior described in Hyperelastic Behavior in Elastomeric Foams, deﬁned by the polynomial
strain energy function
The function 
 is a continuous function of the damage variable, , and is referred to as the “damage function.”
The damage variable varies continuously during the course of the deformation and always satisﬁes 
,
with 
 on the points of the primary curve. The damage function 
 satisﬁes the condition 
; thus,
when the deformation state of the material is on a point on the curve that represents the primary foam behavior,

 and the augmented energy function reduces to the strain energy potential for the primary
foam behavior.
The above expression of the augmented strain energy density function is similar to the form proposed by Ogden
and Roxburgh to model the Mullins effect in ﬁlled rubber elastomers (see Mullins Effect), with the difference
that in the case of elastomeric foams an augmentation of the total strain energy (including the volumetric part)
is considered. This modiﬁcation is required for the model to predict energy absorption under pure hydrostatic
loading of the foam.
Stress Computation
With the above modiﬁcation to the energy function, the stresses are given by
where  is the stress corresponding to the primary foam behavior at the current deformation level 
. Thus, the
stress is obtained by simply scaling the stress of the primary foam behavior by the damage variable, . From
any given strain level the model predicts unloading/reloading along a single curve (that is different, in general,
from the primary foam behavior) that passes through the origin of the stress-strain plot. The model also predicts
energy dissipation under purely volumetric deformation.
Damage Variable
The damage variable, , varies with the deformation according to
where 
 is the maximum value of  at a material point during its deformation history; r, , and m are material
parameters; and 
 is the error function. When 
, corresponding to a point on the primary curve,
. On the other hand, upon removal of deformation, when 
, the damage variable, , attains its
minimum value, 
, given by
For all intermediate values of ,  varies monotonically between 
 and 
. While the parameters r and  are
dimensionless, the parameter m has the dimensions of energy. The material parameters can be speciﬁed directly
or can be computed by Abaqus based on curve ﬁtting of unloading-reloading test data. These parameters are
subject to the restrictions 
, 
, and 
 (the parameters  and m cannot both be zero). Alternatively,
the damage variable  can be deﬁned through user subroutine UMULLINS in Abaqus/Standard and VUMULLINS
in Abaqus/Explicit.
If the parameter 
 and the parameter m has a value that is small compared to 
, the slope of the stress-strain
curve at the initiation of unloading from relatively large strain levels might become very high. As a result, the
response might become discontinuous. This kind of behavior might lead to convergence problems in
Abaqus/Standard. In Abaqus/Explicit the high stiffness will lead to very small stable time increments, thereby
leading to a degradation in performance. This problem can be avoided by choosing a small value for . In
Abaqus/Standard the default value of  is 0. In Abaqus/Explicit, however, the default value of  is 0.1. Thus, if
you do not specify a value for , it is assumed to be 0 in Abaqus/Standard and 0.1 in Abaqus/Explicit.

The parameters r, , and m do not have direct physical interpretations in general. The parameter m controls
whether damage occurs at low strain levels. If 
, there is a signiﬁcant amount of damage at low strain
levels. On the other hand, a nonzero m leads to little or no damage at low strain levels. For further discussion

Defining Isotropic Viscoelasticity
Isotropic time domain viscoelasticity is available in Abaqus for small-strain applications where the
rate-independent elastic response can be deﬁned with a linear elastic material model and for large-strain
applications where the rate-independent elastic response must be deﬁned with a hyperelastic or hyperfoam
material model.
Abaqus Materials Guide
150
Time Domain Viscoelasticity

For isotropic time domain viscoelasticity, Abaqus assumes that the shear (deviatoric) and volumetric behaviors
are independent in multiaxial stress states (except when used for an elastomeric foam).
Defining the Shear Behavior
You can deﬁne the shear behavior at small strain and at large strain.
Small Strain
Consider a shear test at small strain in which a time varying shear strain, 
, is applied to the material. The
response is the shear stress 
. The viscoelastic material model deﬁnes 
 as
where 
 is the time-dependent “shear relaxation modulus” that characterizes the material's response. This
constitutive behavior can be illustrated by considering a relaxation test in which a strain  is suddenly applied
to a specimen and then held constant for a long time. The beginning of the experiment, when the strain is suddenly
applied, is taken as zero time, so that
where  is the ﬁxed strain. The viscoelastic material model is “long-term elastic” in the sense that, after having
been subjected to a constant strain for a very long time, the response settles down to a constant stress; that is,
 as 
.
The shear relaxation modulus can be written in dimensionless form:
where 
 is the instantaneous shear modulus, so that the expression for the stress takes the form
The dimensionless relaxation function has the limiting values 
 and 
.
Anisotropic Elasticity in Abaqus/Explicit
The equation for the shear stress can be transformed using integration by parts:
It is convenient to write this equation in the form
where 
 is the instantaneous shear stress at time t. This can be generalized to multi-dimensions as
where 
 is the deviatoric part of the stress tensor and 
 is the deviatoric part of the instantaneous stress
tensor. Here the viscoelasticity is assumed to be isotropic; that is, the relaxation function is independent of the
loading direction.
151
Abaqus Materials Guide
Time Domain Viscoelasticity

This form allows a straightforward generalization to anisotropic elastic deformations, where the deviatoric part
of the instantaneous stress tensor is computed as 
. Here 
 is the instantaneous deviatoric
elasticity tensor, and  is the deviatoric part of the strain tensor.
Large Strain
The above form also allows a straightforward generalization to nonlinear elastic deformations, where the deviatoric
part of the instantaneous stress 
 is computed using a hyperelastic strain energy potential. This generalization
yields a linear viscoelasticity model, in the sense that the dimensionless stress relaxation function is independent
of the magnitude of the deformation.
In the above equation the instantaneous stress, 
, applied at time 
 inﬂuences the stress, , at time t. Therefore,
to create a proper ﬁnite-strain formulation, map the stress that existed in the conﬁguration at time 
 into the
conﬁguration at time t. In Abaqus, you can do this with the “standard-push-forward” transformation with the
relative deformation gradient 
:
that results in the following hereditary integral:
where  is the deviatoric part of the Kirchhoff stress.
The ﬁnite-strain theory is described in more detail in Finite-strain viscoelasticity.
Defining the Volumetric Behavior
The volumetric behavior can be written in a form that is similar to the shear behavior:
where
p
is the hydrostatic pressure;
is the instantaneous elastic bulk modulus;
s the dimensionless bulk relaxation modulus; and
is the volume strain.
The expansion above applies to small strain and ﬁnite strain because the volume strains are generally small and
you do not need to map the pressure from time 
 to time t.

Time Domain Viscoelasticity

Defining Nonisotropic Viscoelasticity
The stress response of materials with nonisotropic viscoelastic behavior can be written in a general tensorial
form:
where 
 is the 
 component of the time-dependent "relaxation elastic modulus" 
.
The 
 component of the relaxation elastic modulus can be written in dimensionless form (no summation over
repeated indices):
where 
 is the 
 component of the instantaneous elastic modulus 
, so that the expression
for the stress takes the form (no summation over indices inside the parentheses)
Nonisotropic viscoelasticity is available in Abaqus/Standard for small-strain deformation only.
Defining Viscoelastic Behavior for Traction-Separation Elasticity in Abaqus/Explicit
Time domain viscoelasticity can be used in Abaqus/Explicit to model rate-dependent behavior of cohesive
elements with traction-separation elasticity (Deﬁning Elasticity in Terms of Tractions and Separations for
Cohesive Elements). In this case the evolution equation for the normal and two shear nominal tractions take the
form:
where 
, 
, and 
 are the instantaneous nominal tractions at time t in the normal and the two local
shear directions, respectively. The functions 
 and 
 now represent the dimensionless shear and normal
relaxation moduli, respectively. There is close similarity between the viscoelastic formulation for the continuum
elastic response discussed in the previous sections and the formulation for cohesive behavior with
traction-separation elasticity after reinterpreting shear and bulk relaxation as shear and normal relaxation.
For the case of uncoupled traction elasticity, the viscoelastic normal and shear behaviors are assumed to be
independent. The normal relaxation modulus is deﬁned as
where 
 is the instantaneous normal moduli. The shear relaxation modulus is assumed to be isotropic and,
therefore, independent of the local shear directions:
where 
 and 
 are the instantaneous shear moduli.
For the case of coupled traction-separation elasticity, the the normal and shear relaxation moduli must be the
same, 
, and you must use the same relaxation data for both behaviors.

Time Domain Viscoelasticity

Temperature Effects
The effect of temperature, , on the material behavior is introduced through the dependence of instantaneous
stress, 
, on temperature and through a reduced time concept. For isotropic viscoelasticity, the expression for
the linear-elastic shear stress is rewritten as
where the instantaneous shear modulus 
 is temperature dependent and 
 is the reduced time, deﬁned by
where 
 is a shift function at time t. This reduced time concept for temperature dependence is usually
referred to as thermorheologically simple (TRS) temperature dependence. Often the shift function is approximated
by the Williams-Landel-Ferry (WLF) form. See Thermorheologically Simple Temperature Effects below, for a
description of the WLF and other forms of the shift function available in Abaqus.
The reduced time concept is also used for the volumetric behavior of isotropic viscoelasticity, the isotropic
viscoelasticity with large-strain formulation, the nonisotropic viscoelasticity with small-strain formulation, and
the traction-separation formulation.
Numerical Implementation
Abaqus assumes that the viscoelastic material is deﬁned by a Prony series expansion of the dimensionless
relaxation modulus:
where N, 
, and 
, 
, are material constants.
Isotropic Viscoelasticity with Elasticity
For Isotropic viscoelasticity combined with linear isotropic elasticity, substitution in the small-strain expression
for the shear stress yields
where
The 
 are interpreted as state variables that control the stress relaxation, and
is the “creep” strain: the difference between the total mechanical strain and the instantaneous elastic strain (the
stress divided by the instantaneous elastic modulus). In Abaqus/Standard

A similar Prony series expansion is used for the volumetric response, which is valid for both small- and ﬁnite-strain
applications:
where
Abaqus assumes that 
.
For isotropic viscoelasticity combined with linear anisotropic elasticity, when the deviatoric and volumetric
behavior are decoupled or share the same relaxation data, the Prony series expansion, in combination with the
generalized small-strain expression for the deviatoric stress, yields
where
The 
 are interpreted as state variables that control the stress relaxation.
For ﬁnite strains, the Prony series expansion, in combination with the ﬁnite-strain expression for the shear stress,
produces the following expression for the deviatoric stress:
where
The 
 are interpreted as state variables that control the stress relaxation.
When isotropic viscoelasticity is deﬁned, if the instantaneous material behavior is deﬁned by linear elasticity or
hyperelasticity, the bulk and shear behavior can be deﬁned independently. However, if the instantaneous behavior
is deﬁned by the hyperfoam model, the deviatoric and volumetric constitutive behavior are coupled and it is
mandatory to use the same relaxation data for both behaviors. For linear anisotropic elasticity, the same relaxation
data should be used for both behaviors when the elasticity deﬁnition is such that the deviatoric and volumetric
response is coupled; otherwise, relaxation data should be deﬁned for each component of the relaxation modulus.
In all the above expressions, you can introduce temperature dependence by replacing 
 by 
 and
 by 
.
Nonisotropic Viscoelasticity with Elasticity
For nonisotropic viscoelasticity, the bulk and shear behavior can be coupled, and it is mandatory to specify
relaxation behavior for all independent constants of the elastic moduli. The Prony series expansion, in combination
with the generalized small-strain elasticity expression for the stress, yields

where
The  are interpreted as state variables that control the relaxation of the traction stresses.
For coupled traction-separation elasticity you must use the same relaxation data for the normal and shear behaviors.
In all the expressions above, you can introduce temperature dependence by replacing

 and

.
Determination of Isotropic Viscoelastic Material Parameters
The above equations are used to model the time-dependent behavior of a viscoelastic material. For isotropic
viscoelasticity, the relaxation parameters for the shear and volumetric behaviors can be deﬁned in one of the
following ways:
•
direct speciﬁcation of the Prony series parameters,
•
inclusion of creep test data,
•
inclusion of relaxation test data, or
•
inclusion of frequency-dependent data obtained from sinusoidal oscillation experiments.
Temperature effects are included in the same manner regardless of the method used to deﬁne the viscoelastic
material.
Abaqus/CAE allows you to evaluate the behavior of viscoelastic materials by automatically creating response
curves based on experimental test data or coefﬁcients. A viscoelastic material can be evaluated only if it is
deﬁned in the time domain and includes hyperelastic and/or elastic material data. See Evaluating hyperelastic,
hyperfoam and viscoelastic material behavior.

The Prony series terms can also be calibrated using frequency-dependent test data. In this case Abaqus uses
analytical expressions that relate the Prony series relaxation functions to the storage and loss moduli. The

Calibrating the Prony Series Parameters
You can specify two optional parameters related to the calibration of Prony series parameters for viscoelastic

data points in the least-squares ﬁt, and its default value is 0.01.

You can use the following guidelines to determine the number of terms in the Prony series from test data. Based
on these guidelines, you can choose

•
There should be enough data pairs for determining all the parameters in the Prony series terms. Therefore,
assuming that N is the number of Prony series terms, there should be a total of at least 
 data points in
shear test data, 
 data points in volumetric test data, 
 data points in combined test data, and 
 data
points in the frequency domain.

Thermorheologically Simple Temperature Effects
Regardless of the method you use to deﬁne the viscoelastic behavior, you can include thermorheologically simple
temperature effects by specifying the method to use to deﬁne the shift function. Abaqus supports the following
forms of the shift function: the Williams-Landel-Ferry (WLF) form, the Arrhenius form, the tabular form, and
user-deﬁned forms.
Thermorheologically simple temperature effects can also be included in the deﬁnition of equation of state models
with viscous shear behavior (see Viscous Shear Behavior).
Williams-Landel-Ferry (WLF) Form
The shift function can be deﬁned by the Williams-Landel-Ferry (WLF) approximation, which takes the form:
where 
 is the reference temperature at which the relaxation data are given;  is the temperature of interest; and
, 
 are calibration constants obtained at this temperature. If

based on the instantaneous moduli.

Defining the Rate-Independent Part of the Material Response
In all cases elastic moduli must be speciﬁed to deﬁne the rate-independent part of the material behavior.
Small-strain linear elastic behavior is deﬁned by an elastic material model (Linear Elastic Behavior), and
large-deformation behavior is deﬁned by a hyperelastic (Hyperelastic Behavior of Rubberlike Materials) or
hyperfoam (Hyperelastic Behavior in Elastomeric Foams) material model. The rate-independent elasticity for
any of these models can be deﬁned in terms of either instantaneous elastic moduli or long-term elastic moduli.
The choice of deﬁning the elasticity in terms of instantaneous or long-term moduli is a matter of convenience
only; it does not have an effect on the solution.
The effective relaxation moduli are obtained by multiplying the instantaneous elastic moduli with the dimensionless
relaxation functions as described below.

Material Response in Different Analysis Procedures
The time-domain viscoelastic material model is active during the following procedures:
•
transient static analysis (Quasi-Static Analysis),
•
transient implicit dynamic analysis (Implicit Dynamic Analysis Using Direct Integration),
•
explicit dynamic analysis (Explicit Dynamic Analysis),
•
steady-state transport analysis (Steady-State Transport Analysis),
•
fully coupled temperature-displacement analysis (Fully Coupled Thermal-Stress Analysis),
165
Abaqus Materials Guide
Time Domain Viscoelasticity

•
fully coupled thermal-electrical-structural analysis (Fully Coupled Thermal-Electrical-Structural Analysis),
and
•
transient (consolidation) coupled pore ﬂuid diffusion and stress analysis (Coupled Pore Fluid Diffusion and
Stress Analysis).
Viscoelastic material response is always ignored in a static analysis. It can also be ignored in a coupled
temperature-displacement analysis, a coupled thermal-electrical-structural analysis, or a soils consolidation
analysis by specifying that no creep or viscoelastic response is occurring during the step even if creep or
viscoelastic material properties are deﬁned (see Fully Coupled Thermal-Stress Analysis or Coupled Pore Fluid
Diffusion and Stress Analysis). In these cases it is assumed that the loading is applied instantaneously, so that
the resulting response corresponds to an elastic solution based on instantaneous elastic moduli.
Abaqus/Standard also provides the option to obtain the fully relaxed long-term elastic solution directly in a static
or steady-state transport analysis without having to perform a transient analysis. The long-term value is used for
this purpose. The viscous damping stresses (the internal stresses associated with each of the Prony-series terms)
are increased gradually from their values at the beginning of the step to their long-term values at the end of the
step if the long-term value is speciﬁed.
If a time-domain viscoelastic response is speciﬁed for a frequency domain procedure, the viscoelastic response
is ignored and the material response is based on the instantaneous elastic moduli.
Material Options
The viscoelastic material model must be combined with an elastic material model. It is used with the isotropic,
transversely isotropic, orthotropic, or anisotropic linear elasticity model (Linear Elastic Behavior) to deﬁne
classical, linear, small-strain, viscoelastic behavior or with the hyperelastic (Hyperelastic Behavior of Rubberlike
Materials) or hyperfoam (Hyperelastic Behavior in Elastomeric Foams) models to deﬁne large-deformation,
nonlinear, viscoelastic behavior. It can also be used with anisotropic linear elasticity and with traction-separation
elastic behavior in Abaqus/Explicit. The elastic properties deﬁned for these models can be temperature dependent.
Viscoelasticity cannot be combined with any of the plasticity models. See Combining Material Behaviors for
more details.
Elements
The time domain viscoelastic material model can be used with any stress/displacement, coupled
temperature-displacement, or thermal-electrical-structural element in Abaqus, except when you specify transversely
isotropic, orthotropic, or anisotropic linear behaviors in Abaqus/Standard. In this case, Abaqus/Standard supports
only three-dimensional, plane strain, and axisymmetric continuum stress/displacement elements.
Output
In addition to the standard output identiﬁers available in Abaqus (Abaqus/Standard Output Variable Identiﬁers
and Abaqus/Explicit Output Variable Identiﬁers), the following variables have special meaning in Abaqus/Standard
if viscoelasticity is deﬁned:

Considerations for Steady-State Transport Analysis
When a steady-state transport analysis (Steady-State Transport Analysis) is combined with large-strain
viscoelasticity, the viscous dissipation, CENER, is computed as the energy dissipated per revolution as a material
point is transported around its streamline; that is,
Consequently, all the material points in a given streamline report the same value for CENER, and other derived
quantities such as ELCD and ALLCD also have the meaning of dissipation per revolution. The recoverable
elastic strain energy density, SENER, is approximated as
where 
 is the incremental energy input and  is the time at the beginning of the current increment. Since two
different units are used in the quantities appearing in the above equation, a proper meaning cannot be assigned
to quantities such as SENER, ELSE, ALLSE, and ALLIE.
Considerations for Large-Strain Viscoelasticity
In Abaqus/Standard the viscous energy dissipated is computed only approximately for large-strain viscoelasticity.
Abaqus/Explicit does not compute the viscous dissipation for performance reasons for the case of large-strain
viscoelasticity. Instead, the contribution of viscous dissipation is included in the strain energy output, SENER;
and CENER is output as zero. Consequently, special care must be exercised when interpreting strain energy
results of large-strain viscoelastic materials in Abaqus/Explicit since they include viscous dissipation effects.

Overview
The frequency domain viscoelastic material model:
•
describes frequency-dependent material behavior in small steady-state harmonic oscillations for those materials in
which dissipative losses caused by “viscous” (internal damping) effects must be modeled in the frequency domain;
•
can be used to describe isotropic, transversely isotropic, and orthotropic dissipative losses in the frequency domain;
•
can be used in large-strain problems;
•
can be used only with Linear Elastic Behavior, Hyperelastic Behavior of Rubberlike Materials, and Hyperelastic
Behavior in Elastomeric Foams to deﬁne the long-term elastic material properties;
•
can be used with the elastic-damage gasket behavior (Deﬁning a Nonlinear Elastic Model with Damage ) to deﬁne
the effective thickness-direction storage and loss moduli for gasket elements; and
•
is active only during the direct-solution steady-state dynamic (Direct-Solution Steady-State Dynamic Analysis),
the subspace-based steady-state dynamic (Subspace-Based Steady-State Dynamic Analysis), the natural frequency
extraction (Natural Frequency Extraction), and the complex eigenvalue extraction (Complex Eigenvalue Extraction)
procedures.
Defining Isotropic Viscoelasticity
For isotropic frequency domain viscoelasticity, Abaqus assumes that the shear (deviatoric) and volumetric
behaviors are independent in multiaxial stress states.
Defining the Shear Behavior
Consider a shear test at small strain, in which a harmonically varying shear strain  is applied:
where 
 is the amplitude, 
,  is the circular frequency, and t is time. We assume that the specimen
has been oscillating for a very long time so that a steady-state solution is obtained. The solution for the shear
stress then has the form
Abaqus Materials Guide
168
Frequency Domain Viscoelasticity

where 
 and 
 are the shear storage and loss moduli. These moduli can be expressed in terms of the (complex)
Fourier transform 
 of the nondimensional shear relaxation function 
:
where 
 is the time-dependent shear relaxation modulus, 
 and 
 are the real and imaginary parts
of 
, and 
 is the long-term shear modulus. See Frequency domain viscoelasticity for details.
The above equation states that the material responds to steady-state harmonic strain with a stress of magnitude
 that is in phase with the strain and a stress of magnitude 
 that lags the excitation by 
. Therefore,
we can regard the factor
as the complex, frequency-dependent shear modulus of the steadily vibrating material. The absolute magnitude
of the stress response is
and the phase lag of the stress response is
Measurements of 
 and  as functions of frequency in an experiment can, therefore, be used to deﬁne 
 and
 and, thus, 
 and 
 as functions of frequency.
Unless stated otherwise explicitly, all modulus measurements are assumed to be “true” quantities.
Defining the Volumetric Behavior
For isotropic viscoelasticity, the frequency dependence of the shear (deviatoric) and volumetric behaviors are
independent. The volumetric behavior is deﬁned by the bulk storage and loss moduli 
 and 
. Similar
to the shear moduli, these moduli can also be expressed in terms of the (complex) Fourier transform 
 of
the nondimensional bulk relaxation function 
:
where 
 is the long-term elastic bulk modulus.
Large-Strain Viscoelasticity
The linearized vibrations can also be associated with an elastomeric material whose long-term (elastic) response
is nonlinear and involves ﬁnite strains (a hyperelastic material). We can retain the simplicity of the steady-state
small-amplitude vibration response analysis in this case by assuming that the linear expression for the shear
stress still governs the system, except that now the long-term shear modulus 
 can vary with the amount of
static prestrain :
The essential simpliﬁcation implied by this assumption is that the frequency-dependent part of the material's
response, deﬁned by the Fourier transform 
 of the relaxation function, is not affected by the magnitude of
169
Abaqus Materials Guide
Frequency Domain Viscoelasticity

the prestrain. Therefore, strain and frequency effects are separated, which is a reasonable approximation for
many materials.
Another implication of the above assumption is that the anisotropy of the viscoelastic moduli has the same strain
dependence as the anisotropy of the long-term elastic moduli. Therefore, the viscoelastic behavior in all deformed
states can be characterized by measuring the (isotropic) viscoelastic moduli in the undeformed state.
In situations where the above assumptions are not reasonable, the data can be speciﬁed based on measurements
at the prestrain level about which the steady-state dynamic response is desired. In this case you must measure
, 
, and 
 (likewise 
, 
, and 
) at the prestrain level of interest. Alternatively, the viscoelastic data
can be given directly in terms of uniaxial and volumetric storage and loss moduli that might be speciﬁed as
functions of frequency and prestrain (see Direct Speciﬁcation of Storage and Loss Moduli for Large-Strain
Isotropic Viscoelasticity below.)
The generalization of these concepts to arbitrary three-dimensional deformations is provided in Abaqus/Standard
by assuming that the frequency-dependent material behavior has two independent components: one associated
with shear (deviatoric) straining and the other associated with volumetric straining. In the general case of a
compressible material, the model is, therefore, deﬁned for kinematically small perturbations about a predeformed
state as

For a fully incompressible material, only the deviatoric terms in the ﬁrst constitutive equation above remain and
the viscoelastic behavior is completely deﬁned by 
.
Defining Nonisotropic Viscoelasticity
For nonisotropic frequency domain viscoelasticity, the viscoelastic behavior is deﬁned by the storage and loss
moduli 
 and 
. Similar to the shear and bulk moduli deﬁned for isotropic viscoelasticity, the
components of the elastic moduli can also be expressed in terms of the (complex) Fourier transform 
of the nondimensional relaxation function 
:
where

 component of the long-term elastic modulus

You can use nonisotropic viscoelasticity only with the small-strain formulation.
Determination of Isotropic Viscoelastic Material Parameters
When the dissipative part of the material behavior is isotropic, it can be deﬁned by giving the real and imaginary
parts of 
 and 
 (for compressible materials) as functions of frequency. The moduli can be deﬁned as functions
of the frequency in one of three ways: by a power law, by tabular input, or by a Prony series expression for the
shear and bulk relaxation moduli.

The frequency dependence can be deﬁned by the power law formulas

Abaqus provides an alternative approach for specifying the viscoelastic properties of hyperelastic and hyperfoam
materials. This approach involves the direct (tabular) speciﬁcation of storage and loss moduli from uniaxial and
volumetric tests, as functions of excitation frequency and a measure of the level of prestrain. The level of prestrain
refers to the level of elastic deformation at the base state about which the steady-state harmonic response is
desired. This approach is discussed in Direct Speciﬁcation of Storage and Loss Moduli for Large-Strain Isotropic
Viscoelasticity below.

the time-dependent shear modulus can be written in the frequency domain as follows:

of terms in the Prony series. The expressions for the bulk moduli,

Abaqus/Standard automatically performs the conversion from the time domain to the frequency domain. The
Prony series parameters 
 can be deﬁned in one of three ways: direct speciﬁcation of the Prony series
parameters, inclusion of creep test data, or inclusion of relaxation test data. If you specify creep test data or
relaxation test data, Abaqus/Standard determines the Prony series parameters in a nonlinear least-squares ﬁt. A
detailed description of the calibration of Prony series terms is provided in Time Domain Viscoelasticity.
For the test data, you can specify the normalized shear and bulk data separately as functions of time or specify
the normalized shear and bulk data simultaneously. A nonlinear least-squares ﬁt is performed to determine the

Determination of Nonisotropic Viscoelastic Material Parameters
When the dissipative part of the material behavior is nonisotropic, it can be deﬁned by giving the real and
imaginary parts of 
 as a function of frequency. The moduli can be deﬁned as function of the frequency by a
Prony series expression for the relaxation moduli.
The frequency dependence can be obtained from a time domain Prony series description of the

frequency-dependent uniaxial storage and loss moduli,

In that case the data must be converted to obtain the frequency-dependent shear storage and loss moduli

In many cases the viscous behavior is associated only with deviatoric straining, so that the bulk modulus is real
and constant: 
 and 
. For this case, the expressions for the shear moduli simplify to
Incompressible Materials
If the bulk modulus is very large compared to the shear modulus, the material can be considered to be
incompressible, and the expressions simplify further to
Direct Specification of Storage and Loss Moduli for Large-Strain Isotropic Viscoelasticity
For large-strain viscoelasticity Abaqus allows direct speciﬁcation of storage and loss moduli from uniaxial and
volumetric tests. This approach can be used when the assumption of the independence of viscoelastic properties
on the prestrain level is too restrictive.
You specify the storage and loss moduli directly as tabular functions of frequency, and you specify the level of
prestrain at the base state about which the steady-state dynamic response is desired. For uniaxial test data the
measure of prestrain is the uniaxial nominal strain; for volumetric test data the measure of prestrain is the volume
ratio. Abaqus internally converts the data that you specify to ratios of shear/bulk storage and loss moduli to the
corresponding long-term elastic moduli. Subsequently, the basic formulation described in Large-Strain
Viscoelasticity above is used.
175
Abaqus Materials Guide
Frequency Domain Viscoelasticity

For a general three-dimensional stress state it is assumed that the deviatoric part of the viscoelastic response
depends on the level of prestrain through the ﬁrst invariant of the deviatoric left Cauchy-Green strain tensor (see
Hyperelastic material behavior for a deﬁnition of this quantity), while the volumetric part depends on the prestrain
through the volume ratio. A consequence of these assumptions is that for the uniaxial case, data can be speciﬁed
from a uniaxial-tension preload state or from a uniaxial-compression preload state but not both.
The storage and loss moduli that you specify are assumed to be nominal quantities.
Use the following option to specify only the uniaxial storage and loss moduli:

Type: Isotropic: Preload: Uniaxial and Volumetric
Defining the Rate-Independent Part of the Material Behavior
In all cases elastic moduli must be speciﬁed to deﬁne the rate-independent part of the material behavior. The
elastic behavior is deﬁned by an elastic, hyperelastic, or hyperfoam material model. Since the frequency domain
viscoelastic material model is developed around the long-term elastic moduli, the rate-independent elasticity
must be deﬁned in terms of long-term elastic moduli. This implies that the response in any analysis procedure
other than a direct-solution steady-state dynamic analysis (such as a static preloading analysis) corresponds to
the fully relaxed long-term elastic solution.
Material Options
The viscoelastic material model must be combined with the isotropic, transversely isotropic, orthotropic (including
engineering constants), or anisotropic linear elasticity model to deﬁne classical, linear, small-strain, viscoelastic
behavior. It is combined with the hyperelastic or hyperfoam model to deﬁne large-deformation, nonlinear,
viscoelastic behavior. The long-term elastic properties deﬁned for these models can be temperature dependent.
Viscoelasticity cannot be combined with any of the plasticity models. See Combining Material Behaviors for
more details.
Defining the Model with Nonisotropic Linear Elastic Behavior
Abaqus supports the combination of frequency domain viscoelasticity with nonisotropic linear elasticity.
Abaqus Materials Guide
176
Frequency Domain Viscoelasticity

When isotropic viscoelasticity is deﬁned, if the speciﬁed shear (deviatoric) and volumetric viscoelastic behaviors
are different, Abaqus must split the stiffness matrix into the corresponding deviatoric and volumetric parts to
account for the frequency dependence of the material. If the stiffness matrix is deﬁned in a manner such that it
cannot be separated into purely deviatoric and volumetric parts, the analysis ends with an error. This restriction
does not apply when the speciﬁed shear and volumetric viscoelastic behavior are identical because the stiffness
matrix does not have to be split in this case.
Transversely isotropic viscoelasticity can only be combined with transversely isotropic linear elasticity model,
and orthotropic viscoelasticity can only be combined with orthotropic linear elasticity model.
Elements
You can use the isotropic frequency domain viscoelastic material model with any stress/displacement element
in Abaqus/Standard. When nonisotropic viscoelasticity is deﬁned, Abaqus/Standard supports only
three-dimensional, plane strain, and axisymmetric continuum stress/displacement elements.

Overview
The structural relaxation model:
•
can be isotropic, orthotropic, or fully anisotropic; and
•
uses ﬁctive temperature to describe the structure of glass.
Structural Relaxation
At high temperatures glass behaves like a liquid, while at low temperatures glass behaves like a thermoelastic
solid. In both temperature ranges the physical properties of glass depend only on the instantaneous value of the
temperature. However, at temperatures in the vicinity of the glass transition temperature the behavior of glass
is different. In this temperature range, the molecular structure of glass changes gradually with temperature and
a noticeable delay is observed before the equilibrium state is reached. In this case the physical properties depend
on both the temperature and the thermal history.
Tool-Narayanaswamy-Moynihan Model
In Abaqus/Standard the Tool-Narayanaswamy-Moynihan (TNM) model can be used to predict structural relaxation
in glass. It uses the ﬁctive temperature, 
, originally proposed by Tool to describe the structure of the material.
In the TNM model the thermal strains are obtained from the following relation:

is the thermal expansion coefﬁcient for the liquid state;

For a special case when the thermal expansion coefﬁcients are not temperature- or ﬁeld variable-dependent, it
can be shown that the thermal strain increment can be expressed as
In the TNM model we must specify the coefﬁcients of thermal expansion for both glassy and liquid states.

The structural relaxation model can be used with any stress/displacement element in Abaqus/Standard.
Procedures
The model can be used with all stress/displacement procedure types. However, the time effects are taken into
account only in quasi-static (see Quasi-Static Analysis), coupled temperature-displacement (see Fully Coupled
Thermal-Stress Analysis), and direct-integration implicit dynamic (see Implicit Dynamic Analysis Using Direct
Integration) analyses. In other stress/displacement procedure types the evolution of the ﬁctive temperature is
suppressed, so its value remains unchanged.

elastic;

Strain-Rate-Dependent Material Behavior for Elastomers
Nonlinear strain-rate dependence of elastomers is modeled by decomposing the mechanical response into that
of an equilibrium network (A) corresponding to the state that is approached in long-time stress relaxation tests
and that of a time-dependent network (B) that captures the nonlinear rate-dependent deviation from the equilibrium
state. The total stress is assumed to be the sum of the stresses in the two networks. The deformation gradient,
, is assumed to act on both networks and is decomposed into elastic and inelastic parts in network B according
to the multiplicative decomposition 
The nonlinear rate-dependent material model is capable of
reproducing the hysteretic behavior of elastomers subjected to repeated cyclic loading. It does not model “Mullins
effect”—the initial softening of an elastomer when it is ﬁrst subjected to a load.
The material model is deﬁned completely by:
•
a hyperelastic material model that characterizes the elastic response of the model;
•
a stress scaling factor, S, that deﬁnes the ratio of the stress carried by network B to the stress carried by
network A under instantaneous loading; that is, identical elastic stretching in both networks;
•
a positive exponent, m, generally greater than 1, characterizing the effective stress dependence of the effective
creep strain rate in network B;
•
an exponent, C, restricted to lie in 
, characterizing the creep strain dependence of the effective creep
strain rate in network B;
183

•
a nonnegative constant, A, in the expression for the effective creep strain rate—this constant also maintains
dimensional consistency in the equation; and
•
a constant, E, in the expression for the effective creep strain rate—this constant regularizes the creep strain
rate near the undeformed state.
The effective creep strain rate in network B is given by the expression
where 
 is the effective creep strain rate in network B, 
 is the nominal creep strain in network B, and
 is the effective stress in network B. The chain stretch in network B,

Elements
The use of the hysteresis material model is restricted to elements that can be used with hyperelastic materials

on the plane stress assumption (shell, membrane, and continuum plane stress elements). Hybrid elements can
be used with this model only when the accompanying hyperelasticity deﬁnition is completely incompressible.
When this model is used with reduced-integration elements, the instantaneous elastic moduli are used to calculate
the default hourglass stiffness.

These strain measures are used to approximate the strain energy, SENER, and the viscous dissipation, CENER.
These approximations can lead to underestimation of the strain energy and overestimation of the viscous dissipation
since the effects of internal stresses on these energy quantities are neglected. This inaccuracies might be particularly
noticeable in the case of nonmonotonic loading.

Overview
The parallel rheological framework:
•
consists of multiple viscoelastic networks and, optionally, an elastic-plastic network in parallel;
•
uses a hyperelastic material model to specify the elastic response;
•
can be combined with Mullins effect;
•
bases the elastic-plastic response on multiplicative split of the deformation gradient and the theory of incompressible
isotropic hardening plasticity;
•
can include nonlinear kinematic hardening with multiple backstresses in the elastic-plastic response in
Abaqus/Standard; and
•
uses multiplicative split of the deformation gradient and a ﬂow rule derived from a creep potential to specify the
viscous behavior.
Material Behavior
The parallel rheological framework allows deﬁnition of a nonlinear viscoelastic-elastoplastic model consisting
of multiple networks connected in parallel, as shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1: Nonlinear viscoelastic-elastoplastic model with multiple parallel networks.
The number of viscoelastic networks, N, can be arbitrary; however, at most one equilibrium network (network
 in Figure 1) is allowed in the model. The equilibrium network response might be purely elastic or elastic-plastic.
In addition, it might include Mullins effect to predict material softening. The deﬁnition of the equilibrium network
is optional. If it is not deﬁned, the stress in the material will relax completely over time.
The model can be used to predict complex behavior of materials subjected to ﬁnite strains, which cannot be
modeled accurately using other models available in Abaqus. An example of such complex behavior is depicted
in Figure 2, which shows normalized stress relaxation curves for three different strain levels. This behavior can
be modeled accurately using the nonlinear viscoelastic model depicted in Figure 3, which can be deﬁned within
the framework; but it cannot be captured with the linear viscoelastic model (see Time Domain Viscoelasticity).
In the latter case, the three curves would coincide.

Elastic Behavior
The elastic part of the response for all the networks is speciﬁed using the hyperelastic material model. Any of
the hyperelastic models available in Abaqus can be used (see Hyperelastic Behavior of Rubberlike Materials).
The same hyperelastic material deﬁnition is used for all the networks, scaled by a stiffness ratio speciﬁc to each
network. Consequently, only one hyperelastic material deﬁnition is required by the model along with the stiffness
ratio for each network. The elastic response can be speciﬁed by deﬁning either the instantaneous response or
the long-term response.
Equilibrium Network Behavior
In addition to the elastic response described above, the response of the equilibrium network can include plasticity
and Mullins effect to predict material softening. If the plastic response is deﬁned using isotropic hardening, the
response in the equilibrium network is equivalent to that of the permanent set model available in Abaqus (see
Permanent Set in Rubberlike Materials for a detailed description of the model). In Abaqus/Standard the nonlinear
kinematic hardening model with multiple backstresses can be speciﬁed in addition to isotropic plastic hardening.
The nonlinear kinematic hardening model is a generalization of the model used for metal plasticity. See Models
for Metals Subjected to Cyclic Loading for a detailed description of the model, with the difference that the Cauchy
stress is replaced with the Kirchhoff stress in the current formulation.
Viscous Behavior
Viscous behavior must be deﬁned for each viscoelastic network. It is modeled by assuming the multiplicative
split of the deformation gradient and the existence of the creep potential, 
, from which the ﬂow rule is derived.
In the multiplicative split the deformation gradient is expressed as
where 
 is the elastic part of the deformation gradient (representing the hyperelastic behavior) and 
is the
creep part of the deformation gradient (representing the stress-free intermediate conﬁguration). The creep potential
is assumed to have the general form
where  is the Cauchy stress. If the potential is speciﬁed, the ﬂow rule can be obtained from

Bergstrom-Boyce Model
Abaqus provides two forms to deﬁne the Bergstrom-Boyce creep model. The recommended form of the
Bergstrom-Boyce model is deﬁned as
where
and
 and 
are deﬁned above, and
, m, C, E, and 
are material parameters.
The original Bergstrom-Boyce model has the form

Parallel Rheological Framework

where
,
, and 
are deﬁned above, and
A, m, C, and E
are material parameters.
The recommended form is equivalent to the original form of the Bergstrom-Boyce model. The primary difference
between the two formulations is that the recommended form is written in such a way that parameter values do
not cause numerical difﬁculties, which can happen when the original model is calibrated for strain rate applications.
In addition, the units of all parameters in the recommended form are physical, which makes unit conversion
easier. When the value of the parameter  is very small (
), the recommended form is obtained by
setting 
 and setting 
 to an arbitrary value greater than zero (typically, 
 is set to one).
The response of the network deﬁned by the Bergstrom-Boyce model is very similar to the response of the
time-dependent network in the hysteresis model (see Hysteresis in Elastomers). However, there are also important
differences between the models. In the Bergstrom-Boyce model the equivalent Kirchhoff stress is used instead
of the equivalent Cauchy stress, which is used in the hysteresis model. (The two stress measures become equivalent
for the case of incompressible materials.) In addition, the material parameters, A, in the hysteresis model and
the original form of the Bergstrom-Boyce model differ by a factor of 
. The parameter in the hysteresis model
must be multiplied by 
 to make the parameters equivalent.
Darveaux Model
The original Darveaux model involves both primary and secondary (steady state) creep. It is intended for
applications where loading is applied at the beginning of the analysis, while the modiﬁed Darveaux model is
recommended for arbitrary loading histories. The secondary creep in the Darveaux model is deﬁned by a
hyperbolic-sine law:
The secondary law is modiﬁed to account for the primary creep effects through

,
, and B
are other material parameters.
Modified Darveaux Model
The modiﬁed Darveaux model involves both primary and secondary (steady state) creep, similar to the original
Darveaux model. However, unlike the original Darveaux model, which uses total time to describe primary creep
effects, the modiﬁed Darveaux model uses the accumulated creep strain. This approach provides a solution that
does not depend on the loading sequence when the step time has an idle or no-load period. Both Darveaux models
provide the same response under constant load and temperature applied at the beginning of the analysis (time
zero). However, for arbitrary loading histories, you should use the modiﬁed Darveaux model.
The secondary creep is deﬁned by a hyperbolic-sine law:

Thermal Expansion
Only isotropic thermal expansion is permitted with nonlinear viscoelastic materials (Thermal Expansion).
Defining Viscoelastic Response
The nonlinear viscoelastic response is deﬁned by specifying the identiﬁer, stiffness ratio, and creep law for each
viscoelastic network.
Specifying Network Identifier
Each viscoelastic network in the material model must be assigned a unique network identiﬁer or network id.
The network identiﬁers must be consecutive integers starting with 1. The order in which they are speciﬁed is
not important.
Use the following option to specify the network identiﬁer:
Input File Usage:
*VISCOELASTIC, NONLINEAR, NETWORKID=networkId
Defining the Stiffness Ratio
The contribution of each network to the overall response of the material is determined by the value of the stiffness
ratio, , which is used to scale the elastic response of the network material. The sum of the stiffness ratios of the
viscoelastic networks must be smaller than or equal to 1. If the sum of the ratios is equal to 1, the purely elastic
equilibrium network is not created. If the sum of the ratios is smaller than 1, the equilibrium network is created
with a stiffness ratio, 
, equal to

Power Law Creep Model
The power law model is deﬁned by specifying ﬁve material parameters:

. The parameter 
must be positive. It is introduced for dimensional consistency, and its default value is 1.0. For physically reasonable

Input File Usage:
Numerical Difficulties
Depending on the choice of units, the value of A in the creep models might be very small for typical creep strain
rates. If A is less than 10−27, numerical difﬁculties can cause errors in the material calculations; therefore, a
different system of units should be used to avoid such difﬁculties in the calculation of creep strain increments.
In such cases it is recommended that you use the creep models that do not have the limitation. You can use the
power law model rather than the strain hardening model and the recommended form of the Bergstrom-Boyce
model rather than the original form.
Thermorheologically Simple Temperature Effects
Thermorheologically simple temperature effects can be included for each viscoelastic network. In this case the
creep law is modiﬁed and takes the following form:
where  and

the actual time through the integral differential equation

Abaqus supports the following forms of the shift function: the Williams-Landel-Ferry (WLF) form, the Arrhenius
form, and the tabular form (see Thermorheologically Simple Temperature Effects). In addition, user-deﬁned
forms can be speciﬁed in Abaqus/Standard.

Material Response in Different Analysis Steps
In Abaqus/Standard the material is active during all stress/displacement procedure types. However, the creep
effects are taken into account only in quasi-static (Quasi-Static Analysis), coupled temperature-displacement
(Fully Coupled Thermal-Stress Analysis), direct-integration implicit dynamic (Implicit Dynamic Analysis Using
Direct Integration), and steady-state transport (Steady-State Transport Analysis) analyses. If the material is used
in a steady-state transport analysis, it cannot include plasticity. In other stress/displacement procedures the
evolution of the state variables is suppressed and the creep strain remains unchanged. In Abaqus/Explicit the
creep effects are always active.
Elements
The parallel rheological framework is available with continuum elements that include mechanical behavior
(elements that have displacement degrees of freedom), except for one-dimensional elements. The parallel
rheological framework is also supported with elements that use the plane stress formulation such as solid plane
stress elements, membranes, and shells. However, those elements are not supported with compressible materials.
If a compressible material is speciﬁed with plane stress elements, Abaqus will modify the material to make it
incompressible and issue an informational message.
Output
In addition to the standard output identiﬁers available in Abaqus (Abaqus/Standard Output Variable Identiﬁers
and Abaqus/Explicit Output Variable Identiﬁers), the following variables have special meaning for the nonlinear
viscoelastic material model:

corresponding to other isotropic and kinematic hardening plasticity models can be obtained for this model as
well. In addition, if the Mullins effect is used in the model, the output variables available for the Mullins effect

Overview
The low-density foam material model:
•
is primarily intended for low-density, highly compressible foams with signiﬁcant rate sensitive behavior (such as
polyurethane foam) but can also be used to model nearly incompressible rubberlike materials;
•
ignores strain-rate dependence, tension cutoff, and failure in Abaqus/Standard;
•
requires the direct speciﬁcation of uniaxial stress-strain curves at different strain rates for both tension and
compression;
•
optionally allows the speciﬁcation of lateral strain data to include Poisson effects;
•
allows for the speciﬁcation of optional unloading stress-strain curves for better representation of the hysteretic
behavior and energy absorption during cyclic loading; and
•
requires that geometric nonlinearity be accounted for during the analysis step (see Deﬁning an Analysis and General
and Perturbation Procedures), since it is intended for ﬁnite-strain applications.
Mechanical Response
Low-density, highly compressible elastomeric foams are widely used in the automotive industry as energy
absorbing materials. Foam padding is used in many passive safety systems, such as behind headliners for head
impact protection, in door trims for pelvis and thorax protection, etc. Energy absorbing foams are also commonly
used in packaging of hand-held and other electronic devices.
The low-density foam material model in Abaqus/Explicit is intended to capture the highly strain-rate sensitive
behavior of these materials. The model in Abaqus/Standard is intended to be used in quasi-static analyses where
strain-rate sensitivity can be ignored. The model uses a pseudo visco-hyperelastic formulation where the strain
energy potential is constructed numerically as a function of principal stretches and a set of internal variables
associated with strain rate. By default the Poisson's ratio of the material is assumed to be zero. With this
assumption, the evaluation of the stress-strain response becomes uncoupled along the principal deformation
directions. Optionally, nonzero Poisson effects can be speciﬁed to include coupling along the principal directions.
The model requires as input the stress-strain response of the material for both uniaxial tension and uniaxial
compression tests. Poisson effects can be included by also specifying lateral strain data for each of these tests.
The tests can be performed at different strain rates. For each test the strain data should be given in nominal strain
values (change in length per unit of original length), and the stress data should be given in nominal stress values
(force per unit of original cross-sectional area). Uniaxial tension and compression curves are speciﬁed separately.
The uniaxial stress and strain data are given in absolute values (positive in both tension and compression). On
Abaqus Materials Guide

Low-Density Foams

the other hand, when speciﬁed, the lateral strain data must be negative in tension and positive in compression,
corresponding to a positive Poisson's effect. The model does not support negative Poisson's effect. The
rate-dependent behavior can be speciﬁed by providing the uniaxial stress-strain curves for different values of
nominal strain rates. Only the response of the material in Abaqus/Explicit is affected. Rates effects are ignored
in Abaqus/Standard, and the material response is based on the quasi-static behavior.
Both loading and unloading rate-dependent curves can be speciﬁed to better characterize the hysteretic behavior
and energy absorption properties of the material during cyclic loading. Use positive values of nominal strain
rates for loading curves and negative values for the unloading curves. Currently this option is available only
with linear strain rate interpolation (see Interpolation of Strain Rate–Dependent Data in Abaqus/Explicit). When
the unloading behavior is not speciﬁed directly, the model assumes that unloading occurs along the loading
curve associated with the smallest deformation rate. A representative schematic of typical rate-dependent uniaxial
compression data is shown in Figure 1 with both loading and unloading curves. It is important that the speciﬁed
rate-dependent stress-strain curves do not intersect. Otherwise, the material is unstable, and Abaqus issues an
error message if an intersection between curves is found.

During the analysis, the stress along each principal deformation direction is evaluated by interpolating the
speciﬁed loading/unloading stress-strain curves using the corresponding values of principal nominal strain and
strain rate. The stress is then corrected by a coupling term if non-zero Poisson effects are included. The
representative response of the model for a uniaxial compression cycle is shown in Figure 1.

Relaxation Coefficients in Abaqus/Explicit
Unphysical jumps in stress due to sudden changes in the deformation rate are prevented using a technique based
on viscous regularization. This technique also models stress relaxation effects in a very simplistic manner. In
the case of a uniaxial test, for example, the relaxation time is given as 
 where

Strain Rate in Abaqus/Explicit
When Poisson's ratio is zero, three different strain rate measures can be used for the evaluation of the stress-strain
response along each principal deformation direction for general three-dimensional deformation states: the nominal
volumetric strain rate, the nominal strain rate along each principal deformation direction, or the maximum of
the nominal strain rates along the principal deformation directions. By default, the nominal volumetric strain
rate is used; this approach does not produce rate-sensitive behavior under volume-preserving deformation modes
(for example, simple shear). Alternatively, each principal stress can be evaluated based either on the nominal
strain rate along the corresponding principal direction or the maximum of the nominal strain rates; both these
approaches can provide rate-sensitive behavior for volume-preserving deformation modes. All three strain rate
measures produce identical rate-dependent behavior for uniaxial loading conditions when the Poisson's ratio is
zero.
When non-zero Poisson effects are deﬁned, the model uses the maximum nominal strain rate along the principal
deformation directions for the evaluation of the stress-strain response. This is the default and only strain rate
measure available for this case.
Use the following option to use the volumetric strain rate (default when Poisson's
ratio is zero):

Extrapolation of Stress-Strain Curves
By default, for this material model and for strain values beyond the range of speciﬁed strains, Abaqus extrapolates
the stress-strain curves using the slope at the last data point.
When the strain rate value exceeds the maximum speciﬁed strain rate, Abaqus/Explicit uses the stress-strain
curve corresponding to the maximum speciﬁed strain rate by default. You can override this default and activate
strain rate extrapolation based on the slope (with respect to strain rate).

Compressibility
The low-density foam model is primarily intended for highly compressible material behavior. In this case the
model is formulated in terms of total principal stretches such that the deviatoric (distortional) and volumetric
response are fully coupled. Optionally, you can use the model with nearly incompressible rubberlike materials.
For such materials Abaqus switches to a deviatoric formulation that decouples distortional and volumetric
deformation, which improves the robustness of the solution. Abaqus uses this deviatoric formulation automatically
if the Poisson’s ratio of the material speciﬁed is greater than 0.475. In Abaqus/Standard it is recommended that
you use solid continuum hybrid elements in this case to avoid potential convergence problems.
Tension Cutoff and Failure in Abaqus/Explicit
Low-density foams have limited strength in tension and can easily rupture under excessive tensile loading. The
model in Abaqus/Explicit provides the option to specify a cutoff value for the maximum principal tensile stress
that the material can sustain. The maximum principal stresses computed by the program will stay at or below
this value. You can also activate deletion (removal) of the element from the simulation when the tension cutoff
value is reached, which provides a simple method for modeling rupture.
When speciﬁed, the tension cutoff and failure options are ignored in Abaqus/Standard.

Thermal Expansion
Only isotropic thermal expansion is permitted with the low-density foam material model.
The elastic volume ratio,

volume ratio, 
, via the simple relationship:
 is given by
where 
 is the linear thermal expansion strain that is obtained from the temperature and the isotropic thermal
expansion coefﬁcient (Thermal Expansion).
Material Stability
The Drucker stability condition for a compressible material requires that the change in the Kirchhoff stress, 
,
following from an inﬁnitesimal change in the logarithmic strain, 
, satisﬁes the inequality
where the Kirchhoff stress 
. Using 
, the inequality becomes
This restriction requires that the tangential material stiffness 
 be positive deﬁnite.
For an isotropic elastic formulation the inequality can be represented in terms of the principal stresses and strains
Thus, the relation between changes in the stress and changes in the strain can be obtained in the form of the
matrix equation

. Since

When Poisson's ratio is zero, the off diagonal terms of 
 become zero. In that case the necessary conditions for
a positive deﬁnite matrix reduce to 
; that is, the slope of the speciﬁed uniaxial stress-strain curves in the
space of Kirchhoff stress versus logarithmic strain must be positive.
You should be careful deﬁning the input data for the low-density foam model to ensure stable material response
for all strain rates. If an instability is found, Abaqus issues a warning message and prints the lowest value of
strain for which the instability is observed. Ideally, no instability should occur. If instabilities are observed at
strain levels that are likely to occur in the analysis, it is strongly recommended that you carefully examine and
revise the material input data. When nonzero Poisson effects are deﬁned, it is highly recommended that you
provide uniaxial test data in tension and compression for the same range of strain rates.
Elements
The low-density foam model can be used with solid (continuum) elements and generalized plane strain elements.
One-dimensional solid elements (truss and rebar) are also available for the case when no lateral strains are
speciﬁed (Poisson's ratio is zero). The model cannot be used with shell elements or membrane elements.
Procedures
The low-density foam model must always be used with geometrically nonlinear analyses (General and
Perturbation Procedures).

Overview
The superelasticity model provided in Abaqus:
•
can be used to model the stress-induced transformation of austenite to single variant martensite, the stress-induced
transformation of martensite to austenite, reorientation of martensite, and the shape setting process; and
•
is based on the work of Auricchio and Taylor (1996, 1997).
Material Behavior
The superelastic model is based on the uniaxial stress-strain response of phase transforming materials (Figure
1). Such materials (for example, Nitinol) are in the austenite phase under no loading conditions. Austenite is
assumed to follow isotropic linear elasticity. On loading the material, the austenite phase starts transforming
into martensite beyond a certain stress. Martensite is also assumed to follow isotropic linear elasticity. During
the phase transformation, elastic properties are calculated from the elastic constants of austenite and martensite,
following the rule of mixtures:
where  is the fraction of martensite, 
 is the Young's modulus of austenite, 
 is the Young's modulus of
martensite, 
 is the Poisson's ratio of austenite, and 
 is the Poisson's ratio of martensite. After a certain stress,
austenite is completely transformed into martensite, which deforms elastically thereafter. Therefore, the
deformation follows the elastic constants of austenite when the fraction of martensite is zero and follows the
elastic constants of martensite if the fraction of martensite is one (full transformation). On unloading, martensite
transforms back into austenite and the transformation strain is fully recovered. However, the stress at which the
reverse transformation occurs is different from the stress at which the austenite to martensite transformation
occurred.

The transformation surface, 
, is also assumed to follow the Drucker-Prager form. It varies linearly with
temperature, :
In the case of tensile loading, 
 should lie between 
 and 
; during unloading, 
 should be between 
and 
. A difference in the response of the specimen during loading in tension and compression can be obtained
by specifying a value of 
, which is different from 
. The angles  and  are calculated from the tensile and
compressive transformation stress levels, the uniaxial transformation strain, and the user-speciﬁed volumetric
transformation strain. The transformation stress levels must be positive for physically meaningful and converged
results. For example, if the unloading transformation stress levels become negative, unrealistic results (due to
incomplete reverse transformation) or even nonconvergence can occur during unloading. Nonconvergence can
also occur if the transformation is not fully reversed by the time  reaches 0, which could happen for tensile
hydrostatic pressures 
. It is recommended that you avoid specifying parameters
leading to a large value of 
 that can compromise the performance of the model under hydrostatic tension.

Inelastic Mechanical Properties

Inelastic Behavior
Overview
The material library in Abaqus includes several models of inelastic behavior.
Classical metal plasticity
The yield and inelastic ﬂow of a metal at relatively low temperatures, where loading is relatively monotonic and
creep effects are not important, can typically be described with the classical metal plasticity models (Classical
Metal Plasticity). In Abaqus these models use standard Mises or quadratic Hill yield surfaces with associated
plastic ﬂow. Perfect plasticity and isotropic hardening deﬁnitions are both available in the classical metal plasticity
models. Common applications include crash analyses, metal forming, and general collapse studies; the models
are simple and adequate for such cases.
Models for metals subjected to cyclic loading
A linear kinematic hardening model or a nonlinear isotropic/kinematic hardening model (Models for Metals
Subjected to Cyclic Loading) can be used in Abaqus to simulate the behavior of materials that are subjected to
cyclic loading. The evolution law in these models consists of a kinematic hardening component (which describes
the translation of the yield surface in stress space) and, for the nonlinear isotropic/kinematic hardening model,
of an isotropic component (which describes the change of the elastic range). The Bauschinger effect and plastic
shakedown can be modeled with both models, but the nonlinear isotropic/kinematic hardening model provides
more accurate predictions. Ratcheting and relaxation of the mean stress are accounted for only by the nonlinear
isotropic/kinematic model. In addition to these two models, the ORNL model in Abaqus/Standard can be used
when simple life estimation is desired for the design of stainless steels subjected to low-cycle fatigue and creep
fatigue (see below).
Rate-dependent yield
As strain rates increase, many materials show an increase in their yield strength. Rate dependence (Rate-Dependent
Yield) can be deﬁned in Abaqus for a number of plasticity models. Rate dependence can be used in both static
and dynamic procedures. Applicable models include classical metal plasticity, extended Drucker-Prager plasticity,
and crushable foam plasticity.
Creep and swelling
Abaqus/Standard provides a material model for classical metal creep behavior and time-dependent volumetric
swelling behavior (Rate-Dependent Plasticity: Creep and Swelling). This model is intended for relatively slow
(quasi-static) inelastic deformation of a model such as the high-temperature creeping ﬂow of a metal or a piece
of glass. The creep strain rate is assumed to be purely deviatoric, meaning that there is no volume change
associated with this part of the inelastic straining. Creep can be used with the classical metal plasticity model,
with the ORNL model, and to deﬁne rate-dependent gasket behavior (Deﬁning the Gasket Behavior Directly
Using a Gasket Behavior Model). Swelling can be used with the classical metal plasticity model. (Usage with
the Drucker-Prager models is explained below.)

Inelastic Behavior

Annealing or melting
Abaqus provides a modeling capability for situations in which a loss of memory related to hardening occurs
above a certain user-deﬁned temperature, known as the annealing temperature (Annealing or Melting). It is
intended for use with metals subjected to high-temperature deformation processes, in which the material may
undergo melting and possibly resolidiﬁcation or some other form of annealing. In Abaqus annealing or melting
can be modeled with classical metal plasticity (Mises and Hill); in Abaqus/Explicit annealing or melting can
also be modeled with Johnson-Cook plasticity. The annealing temperature is assumed to be a material property.
See Annealing for information on an alternative method for simulating annealing in Abaqus/Explicit.
Hill anisotropic yield and creep
Abaqus provides an anisotropic yield model using Hill's quadratic potential (Hill Anisotropic Yield/Creep), which
is available for use with materials modeled with classical metal plasticity (Classical Metal Plasticity), kinematic
hardening (Models for Metals Subjected to Cyclic Loading), and/or creep (Rate-Dependent Plasticity: Creep
and Swelling) that exhibit different yield stresses in different directions. The Abaqus/Standard model includes
creep; creep behavior is not available in Abaqus/Explicit. The model allows for the speciﬁcation of different
stress ratios for each stress component to deﬁne the initial anisotropy. The model is not adequate for cases in
which the anisotropy changes signiﬁcantly as the material deforms as a result of loading.
Nonquadratic yield
Abaqus/Explicit provides yield models using nonquadratic stress potential functions (Nonquadratic Yield), such
as Tresca and Hosford yield surfaces for isotropic yield and Barlat yield surfaces for anisotropic yield. Compared
with Hill anisotropic plasticity, Barlat anisotropic plasiticity provides ﬂexibility for describing more complex
anisotropic yield behavior. The anisotropy coefﬁcients speciﬁed for Barlat yield surfaces are used to deﬁne the
initial anisotropy. The model is not adequate for cases in which the anisotropy changes signiﬁcantly as the
material deforms as a result of loading.
Johnson-Cook plasticity
The Johnson-Cook plasticity model in Abaqus/Explicit (Johnson-Cook Plasticity) is particularly suited to model
high-strain-rate deformation of metals. This model is a particular type of Mises plasticity that includes analytical
forms of the hardening law and rate dependence. It is generally used in adiabatic transient dynamic analysis.
Dynamic failure models
Two types of dynamic failure models are offered in Abaqus/Explicit for the Mises and Johnson-Cook plasticity
models (Dynamic Failure Models). One is the shear failure model, where the failure criterion is based on the
accumulated equivalent plastic strain. Another is the tensile failure model, which uses the hydrostatic pressure
stress as a failure measure to model dynamic spall or a pressure cutoff. Both models offer a number of failure
choices including element removal and are applicable mainly in truly dynamic situations. In contrast, the
progressive failure and damage models (Progressive Damage and Failure) are suitable for both quasi-static and
dynamic situations and have other signiﬁcant advantages.
Porous metal plasticity
The porous metal plasticity model (Porous Metal Plasticity) is used to model materials that exhibit damage in
the form of void initiation and growth, and it can also be used for some powder metal process simulations at
high relative densities (relative density is deﬁned as the ratio of the volume of solid material to the total volume
of the material). The model is based on Gurson's porous metal plasticity theory with void nucleation and is
211
Abaqus Materials Guide
Inelastic Behavior

intended for use with materials that have a relative density that is greater than 0.9. The model is adequate for
relatively monotonic loading.
Cast iron plasticity
The cast iron plasticity model (Cast Iron Plasticity) is used to model gray cast iron, which exhibits markedly
different inelastic behavior in tension and compression. The microstructure of gray cast iron consists of a
distribution of graphite ﬂakes in a steel matrix. In tension the graphite ﬂakes act as stress concentrators, while
in compression the ﬂakes serve to transmit stresses. The resulting material is brittle in tension, but in compression
it is similar in behavior to steel. The differences in tensile and compressive plastic response include: (i) a yield
stress in tension that is three to ﬁve times lower than the yield stress in compression; (ii) permanent volume
increase in tension, but negligible inelastic volume change in compression; (iii) different hardening behavior in
tension and compression. The model is adequate for relatively monotonic loading.
Two-layer viscoplasticity
The two-layer viscoplasticity model in Abaqus/Standard (Two-Layer Viscoplasticity) is useful for modeling
materials in which signiﬁcant time-dependent behavior as well as plasticity is observed. For metals this typically
occurs at elevated temperatures. The model has been shown to provide good results for thermomechanical
loading.
ORNL constitutive model
The ORNL plasticity model in Abaqus/Standard (ORNL – Oak Ridge National Laboratory Constitutive Model)
is intended for cyclic loading and high-temperature creep of type 304 and 316 stainless steel. Plasticity and creep
calculations are provided according to the speciﬁcation in Nuclear Standard NEF 9-5T, “Guidelines and Procedures
for Design of Class I Elevated Temperature Nuclear System Components.” This model is an extension of the
linear kinematic hardening model (discussed above), which attempts to provide for simple life estimation for
design purposes when low-cycle fatigue and creep fatigue are critical issues.
Deformation plasticity
Abaqus/Standard provides a deformation theory Ramberg-Osgood plasticity model (Deformation Plasticity) for
use in developing fully plastic solutions for fracture mechanics applications in ductile metals. The model is most
commonly applied in static loading with small-displacement analysis for which the fully plastic solution must
be developed in a part of the model.
Extended Drucker-Prager plasticity and creep
The extended Drucker-Prager family of plasticity models (Extended Drucker-Prager Models) describes the
behavior of granular materials or polymers in which the yield behavior depends on the equivalent pressure stress.
The inelastic deformation may sometimes be associated with frictional mechanisms such as sliding of particles
across each other.
This class of models provides a choice of three different yield criteria. The differences in criteria are based on
the shape of the yield surface in the meridional plane, which can be a linear form, a hyperbolic form, or a general
exponent form. Inelastic time-dependent (creep) behavior coupled with the plastic behavior is also available in
Abaqus/Standard for the linear form of the model. Creep behavior is not available in Abaqus/Explicit.
Modified Drucker-Prager/Cap plasticity and creep
The modiﬁed Drucker-Prager/Cap plasticity model (Modiﬁed Drucker-Prager/Cap Model) can be used to
simulate geological materials that exhibit pressure-dependent yield. The addition of a cap yield surface helps
Abaqus Materials Guide
212
Inelastic Behavior

control volume dilatancy when the material yields in shear and provides an inelastic hardening mechanism to
represent plastic compaction. In Abaqus/Standard inelastic time-dependent (creep) behavior coupled with the
plastic behavior is also available for this model; two creep mechanisms are possible: a cohesion,
Drucker-Prager-like mechanism and a consolidation, cap-like mechanism.
Mohr-Coulomb plasticity
The Mohr-Coulomb plasticity model (Mohr-Coulomb Plasticity) can be used for design applications in the
geotechnical engineering area. The model uses the classical Mohr-Coloumb yield criterion: a straight line in the
meridional plane and an irregular hexagonal section in the deviatoric plane. However, the Abaqus Mohr-Coulomb
model has a completely smooth ﬂow potential instead of the classical hexagonal pyramid: the ﬂow potential is
a hyperbola in the meridional plane, and it uses the smooth deviatoric section proposed by Menétrey and Willam.
Critical state (clay) plasticity
The clay plasticity model (Critical State (Clay) Plasticity Model) describes the inelastic response of cohesionless
soils. The model provides a reasonable match to the experimentally observed behavior of saturated clays. This
model deﬁnes the inelastic behavior of a material by a yield function that depends on the three stress invariants,
an associated ﬂow assumption to deﬁne the plastic strain rate, and a strain hardening theory that changes the
size of the yield surface according to the inelastic volumetric strain.
Crushable foam plasticity
The foam plasticity model (Crushable Foam Plasticity Models) is intended for modeling crushable foams that
are typically used as energy absorption structures; however, other crushable materials such as balsa wood can
also be simulated with this model. This model is most appropriate for relatively monotonic loading. The crushable
foam model with isotropic hardening is applicable to polymeric foams as well as metallic foams.
Jointed material
The jointed material model in Abaqus/Standard (Jointed Material Model) is intended to provide a simple,
continuum model for a material that contains a high density of parallel joint surfaces in different orientations,
such as sedimentary rock. This model is intended for applications where stresses are mainly compressive, and
it provides a joint opening capability when the stress normal to the joint tries to become tensile.
Concrete
Three different constitutive models are offered in Abaqus for the analysis of concrete at low conﬁning pressures:
the smeared crack concrete model in Abaqus/Standard (Concrete Smeared Cracking); the brittle cracking model
in Abaqus/Explicit (Cracking Model for Concrete); and the concrete damaged plasticity model in both
Abaqus/Standard and Abaqus/Explicit (Concrete Damaged Plasticity). Each model is designed to provide a
general capability for modeling plain and reinforced concrete (as well as other similar quasi-brittle materials) in
all types of structures: beams, trusses, shells, and solids.
The smeared crack concrete model in Abaqus/Standard is intended for applications in which the concrete is
subjected to essentially monotonic straining and a material point exhibits either tensile cracking or compressive
crushing. Plastic straining in compression is controlled by a “compression” yield surface. Cracking is assumed
to be the most important aspect of the behavior, and the representation of cracking and postcracking anisotropic
behavior dominates the modeling.
The brittle cracking model in Abaqus/Explicit is intended for applications in which the concrete behavior is
dominated by tensile cracking and compressive failure is not important. The model includes consideration of
the anisotropy induced by cracking. In compression, the model assumes elastic behavior. A simple brittle failure
criterion is available to allow the removal of elements from a mesh.
213
Abaqus Materials Guide
Inelastic Behavior

The concrete damaged plasticity model in Abaqus/Standard and Abaqus/Explicit is based on the assumption of
scalar (isotropic) damage and is designed for applications in which the concrete is subjected to arbitrary loading
conditions, including cyclic loading. The model takes into consideration the degradation of the elastic stiffness
induced by plastic straining both in tension and compression. It also accounts for stiffness recovery effects under
cyclic loading.
Progressive damage and failure
Abaqus/Explicit offers a general capability for modeling progressive damage and failure in ductile metals and
ﬁber-reinforced composites (Progressive Damage and Failure).

Plasticity Theories
Most materials of engineering interest initially respond elastically. Elastic behavior means that the deformation
is fully recoverable: when the load is removed, the specimen returns to its original shape. If the load exceeds
some limit (the “yield load”), the deformation is no longer fully recoverable. Some part of the deformation will
remain when the load is removed, as, for example, when a paperclip is bent too much or when a billet of metal
is rolled or forged in a manufacturing process. Plasticity theories model the material's mechanical response as
it undergoes such nonrecoverable deformation in a ductile fashion. The theories have been developed most
intensively for metals, but they are also applied to soils, concrete, rock, ice, crushable foam, and so on. These
materials behave in very different ways. For example, large values of pure hydrostatic pressure cause very little
inelastic deformation in metals, but quite small hydrostatic pressure values may cause a signiﬁcant, nonrecoverable
volume change in a soil sample. Nonetheless, the fundamental concepts of plasticity theories are sufﬁciently
general that models based on these concepts have been developed successfully for a wide range of materials.
Most of the plasticity models in Abaqus are “incremental” theories in which the mechanical strain rate is
decomposed into an elastic part and a plastic (inelastic) part. Incremental plasticity models are usually formulated
in terms of
•
a yield surface, which generalizes the concept of “yield load” into a test function that can be used to determine
if the material responds purely elastically at a particular state of stress, temperature, etc;
•
a ﬂow rule, which deﬁnes the inelastic deformation that occurs if the material point is no longer responding
purely elastically; and
•
evolution laws that deﬁne the hardening—the way in which the yield and/or ﬂow deﬁnitions change as
inelastic deformation occurs.
Abaqus/Standard also has a “deformation” plasticity model, in which the stress is deﬁned from the total mechanical
strain. This is a Ramberg-Osgood model (Deformation Plasticity) and is intended primarily for ductile fracture
mechanics applications, where fully plastic solutions are often required.
Elastic Response
The Abaqus plasticity models also need an elasticity deﬁnition to deal with the recoverable part of the strain. In
Abaqus the elasticity is deﬁned by including linear elastic behavior or, if relevant for some plasticity models,
porous elastic behavior in the same material deﬁnition (see Material Data Deﬁnition). In the case of the Mises
and Johnson-Cook plasticity models in Abaqus/Explicit the elasticity can alternatively be deﬁned using an
equation of state with associated deviatoric behavior (see Equation of State).
When performing an elastic-plastic analysis at ﬁnite strains, Abaqus assumes that the plastic strains dominate
the deformation and that the elastic strains are small. This restriction is imposed by the elasticity models that
Abaqus uses. It is justiﬁed because most materials have a well-deﬁned yield point that is a very small percentage
Abaqus Materials Guide
214
Inelastic Behavior

of their Young's modulus; for example, the yield stress of metals is typically less than 1% of the Young's modulus
of the material. Therefore, the elastic strains will also be less than this percentage, and the elastic response of
the material can be modeled quite accurately as being linear.
In Abaqus/Explicit the elastic strain energy reported is updated incrementally. The incremental change in elastic
strain energy (
) is computed as 
, where 
 is the incremental change in total strain
energy and 
 is the incremental change in plastic energy dissipation. 
 is much smaller than 
 and
 for increments in which the deformation is almost all plastic. Approximations in the calculations of 
and 
 result in deviations from the true solutions that are insigniﬁcant compared to 
 and 
 but can
be signiﬁcant relative to 
. Typically, the elastic strain energy solution is quite accurate, but in some rare
cases the approximations in the calculations of 
 and 
 can lead to a negative value reported for the elastic
strain energy. These negative values are most likely to occur in an analysis that uses rate-dependent plasticity.
As long as the absolute value of the elastic strain energy is very small compared to the total strain energy, a
negative value for the elastic strain energy should not be considered an indication of a serious solution problem.
Stress and Strain Measures
Most materials that exhibit ductile behavior (large inelastic strains) yield at stress levels that are orders of
magnitude less than the elastic modulus of the material, which implies that the relevant stress and strain measures
are “true” stress (Cauchy stress) and logarithmic strain. Material data for all of these models should, therefore,
be given in these measures.
If you have nominal stress-strain data for a uniaxial test and the material is isotropic, a simple conversion to true
stress and logarithmic plastic strain is
where E is the Young's modulus.
Example of Stress-Strain Data Input
The example below illustrates the input of material data for the classical metal plasticity model with isotropic
hardening (Classical Metal Plasticity). Stress-strain data representing the material hardening behavior are
necessary to deﬁne the model. An experimental hardening curve might appear as that shown in Figure 1.

Plastic strain values, not total strain values, are used in deﬁning the hardening behavior. Furthermore, the ﬁrst

Specifying Initial Equivalent Plastic Strains
Initial values of equivalent plastic strain can be speciﬁed in Abaqus for elements that use classical metal plasticity
(Classical Metal Plasticity) or Drucker-Prager plasticity (Extended Drucker-Prager Models) by deﬁning initial
hardening conditions (Initial Conditions). The equivalent plastic strain (output variable PEEQ) then contains
the initial value of equivalent plastic strain plus any additional equivalent plastic strain due to plastic straining
during the analysis. However, the plastic strain tensor (output variable PE) contains only the amount of straining
due to deformation during the analysis.
The simple one-dimensional example shown in Figure 2 illustrates the concept.

Overview
The classical metal plasticity models:
•
use Mises or Hill yield surfaces with associated plastic ﬂow, which allow for isotropic and anisotropic yield,
respectively;
•
use perfect plasticity or isotropic hardening behavior;
•
can be used when rate-dependent effects are important;
•
are intended for applications such as crash analyses, metal forming, and general collapse studies (Plasticity models
that include kinematic hardening and are, therefore, more suitable for cases involving cyclic loading are also
available in Abaqus: see Models for Metals Subjected to Cyclic Loading.);
•
can be used in any procedure that uses elements with displacement degrees of freedom;
•
can be used in a fully coupled temperature-displacement analysis (Fully Coupled Thermal-Stress Analysis), a fully
coupled thermal-electrical-structural analysis (Fully Coupled Thermal-Electrical-Structural Analysis), or an adiabatic
thermal-stress analysis (Adiabatic Analysis) such that plastic dissipation results in the heating of a material;
•
can be used in conjunction with the models of progressive damage and failure in Abaqus (About Damage and
Failure for Ductile Metals) to specify different damage initiation criteria and damage evolution laws that allow for
the progressive degradation of the material stiffness and the removal of elements from the mesh;
•
can be used in conjunction with the shear failure model in Abaqus/Explicit to provide a simple ductile dynamic
failure criterion that allows for the removal of elements from the mesh, although the progressive damage and failure
methods discussed above are generally recommended instead;
•
can be used in conjunction with the tensile failure model in Abaqus/Explicit to provide a tensile spall criterion
offering a number of failure choices and removal of elements from the mesh; and
•
must be used in conjunction with either the linear elastic material model (Linear Elastic Behavior) or the equation
of state material model (Equation of State).

Classical Metal Plasticity

Yield Surfaces
The Mises and Hill yield surfaces assume that yielding of the metal is independent of the equivalent pressure
stress: this observation is conﬁrmed experimentally for most metals (except voided metals) under positive
pressure stress but may be inaccurate for metals under conditions of high triaxial tension when voids may nucleate
and grow in the material. Such conditions can arise in stress ﬁelds near crack tips and in some extreme thermal
loading cases such as those that might occur during welding processes. A porous metal plasticity model is
provided in Abaqus for such situations. This model is described in Porous Metal Plasticity.
Mises Yield Surface
The Mises yield surface is used to deﬁne isotropic yielding. It is deﬁned by giving the value of the uniaxial yield
stress as a function of uniaxial equivalent plastic strain, temperature, and/or ﬁeld variables. In Abaqus/Standard
the yield stress can alternatively be deﬁned in user subroutine UHARD.

Hill Yield Surface
The quadratic Hill yield surface allows anisotropic yielding to be modeled. You must specify a reference yield
stress, 
, for the metal plasticity model and deﬁne a set of yield ratios, 
, separately. These data deﬁne the
yield stress corresponding to each stress component as 
. Hill's potential function is discussed in detail in
Hill Anisotropic Yield/Creep. Yield ratios can be used to deﬁne three common forms of anisotropy associated
with sheet metal forming: transverse anisotropy, planar anisotropy, and general anisotropy.
The plasticity model using the Hill yield surface is applicable to strains up to about 25%–30%, and it is not
recommended for analyses in which these values are exceeded.

Hardening
In Abaqus a perfectly plastic material (with no hardening) can be deﬁned, or work hardening can be speciﬁed.
Isotropic hardening, including Johnson-Cook hardening, is available in both Abaqus/Standard and Abaqus/Explicit.
In addition, Abaqus provides kinematic hardening for materials subjected to cyclic loading.
Perfect Plasticity
Perfect plasticity means that the yield stress does not change with plastic strain. It can be deﬁned in tabular form
for a range of temperatures and/or ﬁeld variables; a single yield stress value per temperature and/or ﬁeld variable
speciﬁes the onset of yield.

Abaqus/CAE Usage:
Isotropic Hardening
Isotropic hardening means that the yield surface changes size uniformly in all directions such that the yield stress
increases (or decreases) in all stress directions as plastic straining occurs. Abaqus provides an isotropic hardening
model, which is useful for cases involving gross plastic straining or in cases where the straining at each point is
essentially in the same direction in strain space throughout the analysis. Although the model is referred to as a
“hardening” model, strain softening or hardening followed by softening can be deﬁned. Isotropic hardening
plasticity is discussed in more detail in Isotropic elasto-plasticity.
If isotropic hardening is deﬁned, the yield stress, 
, can be given as a tabular function of equivalent plastic
strain and, if required, of temperature and/or other predeﬁned ﬁeld variables. The yield stress at a given state is
interpolated from this table of data, and it is assumed to remain constant outside the range of the independent
variables other than equivalent plastic strain. Outside the range of equivalent plastic strains, you can choose if
the yield stress remains constant (default) or is extrapolated linearly (see Extrapolation of Material Data).
Abaqus/Explicit regularizes the data into tables that are deﬁned in terms of even intervals of the independent
variables. In some cases where the yield stress is deﬁned at uneven intervals of the independent variable (plastic
strain) and the range of the independent variable is large compared to the smallest interval, Abaqus/Explicit may
fail to obtain an accurate regularization of your data in a reasonable number of intervals. In this case the program
will stop after all data are processed with an error message that you must redeﬁne the material data. See Material
Data Deﬁnition for a more detailed discussion of data regularization.

Johnson-Cook hardening is a particular type of isotropic hardening where the yield stress is given as an analytical

Kinematic Hardening
Three kinematic hardening models are provided in Abaqus to model the cyclic loading of metals. The linear
kinematic model approximates the hardening behavior with a constant rate of hardening. The more general
nonlinear isotropic/kinematic model will give better predictions but requires more detailed calibration. The
multilinear kinematic model combines several piecewise linear hardening curves to predict the complex response
of metals under thermomechanical load cycles. This model is based on Besseling (1958) and is available only
in Abaqus/Standard. For more details, see Models for Metals Subjected to Cyclic Loading.

Flow Rule
Abaqus uses associated plastic ﬂow. Therefore, as the material yields, the inelastic deformation rate is in the
direction of the normal to the yield surface (the plastic deformation is volume invariant). This assumption is
generally acceptable for most calculations with metals; the most obvious case where it is not appropriate is the
detailed study of the localization of plastic ﬂow in sheets of metal as the sheet develops texture and eventually
tears apart. So long as the details of such effects are not of interest (or can be inferred from less detailed criteria,
such as reaching a forming limit that is deﬁned in terms of strain), the associated ﬂow models in Abaqus used
with the smooth Mises or Hill yield surfaces generally predict the behavior accurately.

Rate Dependence
As strain rates increase, many materials show an increase in their yield strength. This effect becomes important
in many metals when the strain rates range between 0.1 and 1 per second; and it can be very important for strain
rates ranging between 10 and 100 per second, which are characteristic of high-energy dynamic events or
manufacturing processes.
There are multiple ways to introduce a strain-rate-dependent yield stress.
Direct Tabular Data
Test data can be provided as tables of yield stress values versus equivalent plastic strain at different equivalent

Progressive Damage and Failure
In Abaqus the metal plasticity material models can be used in conjunction with the progressive damage and
failure models discussed in About Damage and Failure for Ductile Metals. The capability allows for the
speciﬁcation of one or more damage initiation criteria, including ductile, shear, forming limit diagram (FLD),
forming limit stress diagram (FLSD), Müschenborn-Sonne forming limit diagram (MSFLD), and, in
Abaqus/Explicit, Marciniak-Kuczynski (M-K) criteria. After damage initiation, the material stiffness is degraded
progressively according to the speciﬁed damage evolution response. The model offers two failure choices,
including the removal of elements from the mesh as a result of tearing or ripping of the structure. The progressive
damage models allow for a smooth degradation of the material stiffness, making them suitable for both quasi-static

Shear Failure
The shear failure model provides a simple failure criterion that is suitable for high-strain-rate deformation of
many materials including most metals. It offers two failure choices, including the removal of elements from the

temperature dependence of the material properties. It is applicable only to adiabatic thermal-stress analysis
(Adiabatic Analysis), fully coupled temperature-displacement analysis (Fully Coupled Thermal-Stress Analysis),

Overview
The kinematic hardening models:
•
are used to simulate the inelastic behavior of materials that are subjected to cyclic loading;
•
include a linear kinematic hardening model, a nonlinear isotropic/kinematic hardening model, and, in
Abaqus/Standard, a multilinear kinematic hardening model;
•
include a nonlinear isotropic/kinematic hardening model with multiple backstresses and, optionally, static recovery
effects;
•
can be used in any procedure that uses elements with displacement degrees of freedom;
•
in Abaqus/Standard cannot be used in adiabatic analyses;
•
can be used to model rate-dependent yield, except the multilinear kinematic hardening;
•
can be used with creep and swelling in Abaqus/Standard, except the multilinear kinematic hardening model; and
•
require the use of the linear elasticity material model to deﬁne the elastic part of the response.
Yield Surfaces
The kinematic hardening models used to model the behavior of metals subjected to cyclic loading are
pressure-independent plasticity models; in other words, yielding of the metals is independent of the equivalent
pressure stress. These models are suited for most metals subjected to cyclic loading conditions, except voided
metals.
The linear kinematic hardening model can be used with the Mises or Hill yield surface. The nonlinear
isotropic/kinematic model can be used only with the Mises yield surface in Abaqus/Standard and with the Mises
or Hill yield surface in Abaqus/Explicit. The pressure-independent yield surface used in the linear kinematic
hardening model and the nonlinear isotropic/kinematic hardening model is deﬁned by the function
where 
 is the yield stress and 
 is the equivalent Mises stress or Hill's potential with respect to the
backstress . For example, the equivalent Mises stress is deﬁned as
227
Models for Metals Subjected to Cyclic Loading

where  is the deviatoric stress tensor (deﬁned as 
, where  is the stress tensor, p is the equivalent
pressure stress, and  is the identity tensor) and 
 is the deviatoric part of the backstress tensor.
The response in the multilinear kinematic hardening model is assumed to be a weighted sum of various
elastic-perfectly plastic elements. Each of these elements, also referred to as subvolumes, uses the Mises yield
surface with a different yield strength.
Flow Rule
The kinematic hardening models assume associated plastic ﬂow. The assumption of associated plastic ﬂow is
acceptable for metals subjected to cyclic loading as long as microscopic details, such as localization of plastic
ﬂow occurring as a metal component ruptures due to cyclic fatigue loads, are not of interest.
Linear Kinematic Hardening Model and Nonlinear Isotropic/Kinematic Hardening Model
In the case of the linear kinematic hardening model and the nonlinear isotropic/kinematic hardening model:
where 
 is the rate of plastic ﬂow and 
 is the equivalent plastic strain rate.
The evolution of the equivalent plastic strain is obtained from the following equivalent plastic work expression:
which yields 
 for isotropic Mises plasticity.
Multilinear Kinematic Hardening Model
The ﬂow rule for the multilinear kinematic hardening model is as follows:
where 
 is the total number of subvolumes and 
 and 
 are the weights, Mises yield surface, equivalent
plastic strain rate, and the stress of the kth subvolume, respectively. Every subvolume follows an associated ﬂow
rule.
Hardening
The linear kinematic hardening model has a constant hardening modulus, and the nonlinear isotropic/kinematic
hardening model has both nonlinear kinematic and nonlinear isotropic hardening components. The multilinear
kinematic hardening model has a piecewise constant hardening modulus.
Linear Kinematic Hardening Model
The evolution law of this model consists of a linear kinematic hardening component that describes the translation
of the yield surface in stress space through the backstress, . When temperature dependence is omitted, this
evolution law is the linear Ziegler hardening law
Abaqus Materials Guide

Models for Metals Subjected to Cyclic Loading

where 
 is the equivalent plastic strain rate and C is the kinematic hardening modulus. In this model the
equivalent stress deﬁning the size of the yield surface, 
, remains constant, 
, where 
 is the equivalent
stress deﬁning the size of the yield surface at zero plastic strain.
Nonlinear Isotropic/Kinematic Hardening Model
The evolution law of this model consists of two components: a nonlinear kinematic hardening component, which
describes the translation of the yield surface in stress space through the backstress, ; and an isotropic hardening
component, which describes the change of the equivalent stress deﬁning the size of the yield surface, 
, as a
function of plastic deformation.
The kinematic hardening component is deﬁned to be an additive combination of a purely kinematic term (linear
Ziegler hardening law), a relaxation term (the recall or dynamic recovery term), and, optionally, a static recovery
term. The last two terms introduce the nonlinearity. In addition, several kinematic hardening components
(backstresses) can be superposed, which may considerably improve results in some cases. When temperature
and ﬁeld variable dependencies are omitted, the hardening laws for each backstress are

the deviatoric part has an effect on the material behavior. When

an isotropic hardening model. When all 
 and 
 equal zero, the linear Ziegler hardening law is recovered.
Calibration of the material parameters is discussed in Usage and Calibration of the Kinematic Hardening Models
below. Figure 1 shows an example of nonlinear kinematic hardening with three backstresses.

Figure 1: Kinematic hardening model with three backstresses.
Each of the backstresses covers a different range of strains, and the linear hardening law is retained for large
strains.
The isotropic hardening behavior of the model deﬁnes the evolution of the yield surface size, 
, as a function
of the equivalent plastic strain, 
. This evolution can be introduced by specifying 
 directly as a function of
 in tabular form, by specifying 
 in user subroutine UHARD (in Abaqus/Standard only), or by using the
simple exponential law
where 
 is the yield stress at zero plastic strain and 
 and b are material parameters. 
 is the maximum
change in the size of the yield surface, and b deﬁnes the rate at which the size of the yield surface changes as
plastic straining develops. When the equivalent stress deﬁning the size of the yield surface remains constant
(
), the model reduces to a nonlinear kinematic hardening model.
The evolution of the kinematic and the isotropic hardening components is illustrated in Figure 2 for unidirectional
loading and in Figure 3 for multiaxial loading. The evolution law for the kinematic hardening component implies
that the backstress is contained within a cylinder of radius 
, where 
 is the
magnitude of  at saturation (large plastic strains). It also implies that any stress point must lie within a cylinder
of radius 
 (using the notation of Figure 2) since the yield surface remains bounded. At large plastic
strain any stress point is contained within a cylinder of radius 
, where 
 is the equivalent stress
deﬁning the size of the yield surface at large plastic strain. If tabular data are provided for the isotropic component,
 is the last value given to deﬁne the size of the yield surface. If user subroutine UHARD is used, this value
will depend on your implementation; otherwise, 
.
The model is applicable to strains up to about 25%–30%, and it is not recommended for analyses in which these
values are exceeded.

The multilinear kinematic hardening model is deﬁned by giving the value of uniaxial yield stress as a function
of uniaxial plastic strain (Figure 4). The number of stress-plastic strain pairs given on the input curve determines
the number of subvolumes,

Predicted Material Behavior
In the kinematic hardening models the center of the yield surface moves in stress space due to the kinematic
hardening component. In addition, when the nonlinear isotropic/kinematic hardening model is used, the yield
surface range may expand or contract due to the isotropic component. These features allow modeling of inelastic
deformation in metals that are subjected to cycles of load or temperature, resulting in signiﬁcant inelastic
deformation and, possibly, low-cycle fatigue failure. These models account for the following phenomena:
Bauschinger effect
This effect is characterized by a reduced yield stress upon load reversal after plastic deformation has
occurred during the initial loading. This phenomenon decreases with continued cycling. The linear kinematic
hardening component takes this effect into consideration, but a nonlinear component improves the shape
of the cycles. Further improvement of the shape of the cycle can be obtained by using a nonlinear model
Abaqus Materials Guide
232
Models for Metals Subjected to Cyclic Loading

with multiple backstresses. The multilinear kinematic hardening model can also be used to model this
effect.
Cyclic hardening with plastic shakedown
This phenomenon is characteristic of symmetric stress- or strain-controlled experiments. Soft or annealed
metals tend to harden toward a stable limit, and initially hardened metals tend to soften. Figure 5 illustrates
the behavior of a metal that hardens under prescribed symmetric strain cycles.

The kinematic hardening component of the models used alone predicts plastic shakedown after one stress

Ratchetting
Unsymmetric cycles of stress between prescribed limits will cause progressive “creep” or “ratcheting” in
the direction of the mean stress (Figure 6).

Typically, transient ratcheting is followed by stabilization (zero ratchet strain) for low mean stresses, while
a constant increase in the accumulated ratchet strain is observed at high mean stresses. The nonlinear
kinematic hardening component, used without the isotropic hardening component, predicts constant ratchet
strain. The prediction of ratcheting is improved by adding isotropic hardening, in which case the ratchet
strain may decrease until it becomes constant. However, in general the nonlinear hardening model with a
single backstress predicts a too signiﬁcant ratcheting effect. A considerable improvement in modeling
233
Abaqus Materials Guide
Models for Metals Subjected to Cyclic Loading

ratcheting can be achieved by superposing several kinematic hardening models (backstresses) and choosing
one of the models to be linear or nearly linear (
), which results in a less pronounced ratcheting
effect. The multilinear kinematic hardening model cannot predict this effect.
Relaxation of the mean stress
This phenomenon is characteristic of an unsymmetric strain experiment, as shown in Figure 7.
σ
ε
Figure 7: Relaxation of the mean stress.
As the number of cycles increases, the mean stress tends to zero. The nonlinear kinematic hardening
component of the nonlinear isotropic/kinematic hardening model accounts for this behavior.
Limitations
The linear kinematic model is a simple model that gives only a ﬁrst approximation of the behavior of metals
subjected to cyclic loading, as explained above. The nonlinear isotropic/kinematic hardening model can provide
more accurate results in many cases involving cyclic loading, but it still has the following limitations:
•
The isotropic hardening is the same at all strain ranges. Physical observations, however, indicate that the
amount of isotropic hardening depends on the magnitude of the strain range. Furthermore, if the specimen
is cycled at two different strain ranges, one followed by the other, the deformation in the ﬁrst cycle affects
the isotropic hardening in the second cycle. Thus, the model is only a coarse approximation of actual cyclic
behavior. It should be calibrated to the expected size of the strain cycles of importance in the application.
•
The same cyclic hardening behavior is predicted for proportional and nonproportional load cycles. Physical
observations indicate that the cyclic hardening behavior of materials subjected to nonproportional loading
may be very different from uniaxial behavior at a similar strain amplitude.
The example problems Simple proportional and nonproportional cyclic tests, Notched beam under cyclic loading,
and Uniaxial ratcheting under tension and compression illustrate the phenomena of cyclic hardening with plastic
shakedown, ratcheting, and relaxation of the mean stress for the nonlinear isotropic/kinematic hardening model,
as well as its limitations.
Usage and Calibration of the Kinematic Hardening Models
The linear kinematic model approximates the hardening behavior with a constant rate of hardening. This hardening
rate should be matched to the average hardening rate measured in stabilized cycles over a strain range
corresponding to that expected in the application. A stabilized cycle is obtained by cycling over a ﬁxed strain
range until a steady-state condition is reached; that is, until the stress-strain curve no longer changes shape from
Abaqus Materials Guide
234
Models for Metals Subjected to Cyclic Loading

one cycle to the next. The multilinear kinematic hardening model does not have the restriction of a constant
hardening rate. The more general nonlinear model will give better predictions but requires more detailed
calibration.
Linear Kinematic Hardening Model
The test data obtained from a half cycle of a unidirectional tension or compression experiment must be linearized,
since this simple model can predict only linear hardening. The data are usually based on measurements of the
stabilized behavior in strain cycles covering a strain range corresponding to the strain range that is anticipated
to occur in the application. Abaqus expects you to provide only two data pairs to deﬁne this linear behavior: the
yield stress, 
, at zero plastic strain and a yield stress, , at a ﬁnite plastic strain value, 
. The linear kinematic
hardening modulus, C, is determined from the relation
You can provide several sets of two data pairs as a function of temperature to deﬁne the variation of the linear
kinematic hardening modulus with respect to temperature. If the Hill yield surface is desired for this model, you
must specify a set of yield ratios, 
, independently (see Hill Anisotropic Yield/Creep for information on how
to specify the yield ratios).
This model gives physically reasonable results for only relatively small strains (less than 5%).

Defining the Isotropic Hardening Component by Tabular Data
Isotropic hardening can be introduced by specifying the equivalent stress deﬁning the size of the yield surface,
, as a tabular function of the equivalent plastic strain, 
. The simplest way to obtain these data is to conduct
a symmetric strain-controlled cyclic experiment with strain range 
. Since the material's elastic modulus is
large compared to its hardening modulus, this experiment can be interpreted approximately as repeated cycles
over the same plastic strain range 
 (using the notation of Figure 8, where E is the Young's
modulus of the material).

You should provide the tabulated values deﬁning the size of the yield surface for the entire equivalent plastic
strain range to which the material may be subjected. You can provide the data as functions of temperature and/or
ﬁeld variables. The yield stress at a given state is interpolated from this table of data, and it is assumed to remain
constant outside the range of the independent variables other than equivalent plastic strain. Outside the range of
equivalent plastic strains, you can choose if the yield stress remains constant (default) or is extrapolated linearly
(see Extrapolation of Material Data).
To obtain accurate cyclic hardening data, such as would be needed for low-cycle fatigue calculations, the
calibration experiment should be performed at a strain range, 
, that corresponds to the strain range anticipated
in the analysis because the material model does not predict different isotropic hardening behavior at different
strain ranges. This limitation also implies that, even though a component is made from the same material, it may
have to be divided into several regions with different hardening properties corresponding to different anticipated
strain ranges. Field variables and ﬁeld variable dependence of these properties can also be used for this purpose.

The isotropic hardening component should be deﬁned by specifying the equivalent stress deﬁning the size of
the yield surface at zero plastic strain, as well as the evolution of the equivalent stress as a function of equivalent
plastic strain. If this component is not deﬁned, Abaqus will assume that no cyclic hardening occurs so that the
equivalent stress deﬁning the size of the yield surface is constant and equal to 
 (or the average of
these quantities over several strain ranges when more than one strain range is provided). Since this size corresponds
to the size of a saturated cycle, this is unlikely to provide accurate predictions of actual behavior, particularly in
the initial cycles.

that violate these conditions. However, in this case the response corresponding to the backstress for which the
condition is violated produces kinematic softening response: the magnitude of the backstress decreases with
plastic straining from its initial value to the saturation value. If the condition is violated for any of the backstresses,
the overall response of the material is not guaranteed to produce kinematic hardening response. The initial

torsion (i.e., not thin-walled, open sections) and do not include hoop stress (i.e., not PIPE elements) cannot be
used with the nonlinear kinematic hardening model. In Abaqus/Explicit, the linear kinematic hardening model
and the nonlinear isotropic/kinematic hardening model can be used with any elements that include mechanical
behavior, with the exception of one-dimensional elements (beams, pipes, and trusses) when the models are used
with the Hill yield surface. The multilinear kinematic hardening model can be used only in Abaqus/Standard
with plane strain, generalized plane strain, axisymmetric, and three-dimensional solid (continuum) elements.

Overview
Rate-dependent yield:
•
is needed to deﬁne a material's yield behavior accurately when the yield strength depends on the rate of straining
and the anticipated strain rates are signiﬁcant;
•
is available only for the isotropic hardening metal plasticity models (Mises, Johnson-Cook, and Hill), the isotropic
component of the nonlinear isotropic/kinematic plasticity models, the extended Drucker-Prager plasticity model,
and the crushable foam plasticity model;
•
can be conveniently deﬁned on the basis of work hardening parameters and ﬁeld variables by providing tabular
data for the isotropic hardening metal plasticity models, the isotropic component of the nonlinear isotropic/kinematic
plasticity models, and the extended Drucker-Prager plasticity model;
•
can be deﬁned through speciﬁcation of user-deﬁned overstress power law parameters, yield stress ratios, or
Johnson-Cook rate dependence parameters (this last option is not available for the crushable foam plasticity model
and is the only option available for the Johnson-Cook plasticity model);
•
cannot be used with any of the Abaqus/Standard creep models (metal creep, time-dependent volumetric swelling,
Drucker-Prager creep, or cap creep) since creep behavior is already a rate-dependent mechanism; and
•
in dynamic analysis should be speciﬁed such that the yield stress increases with increasing strain rate.
Work Hardening Dependencies
Generally, a material's yield stress,  (or 
 for the crushable foam model), is dependent on work hardening,
which for isotropic hardening models is usually represented by a suitable measure of equivalent plastic strain,
; the inelastic strain rate, 
; temperature, ; and predeﬁned ﬁeld variables, 
:
Many materials show an increase in their yield strength as strain rates increase; this effect becomes important
in many metals and polymers when the strain rates range between 0.1 and 1 per second, and it can be very

244
Rate-Dependent Yield

important for strain rates ranging between 10 and 100 per second, which are characteristic of high-energy dynamic
events or manufacturing processes.
Defining Hardening Dependencies for Various Material Models
Strain rate dependence can be deﬁned by entering hardening curves at different strain rates directly or by deﬁning
yield stress ratios to specify the rate dependence independently.
Direct Entry of Test Data
Work hardening dependencies can be given quite generally as tabular data for the isotropic hardening Mises
plasticity model, the isotropic component of the nonlinear isotropic/kinematic hardening model, and the extended
Drucker-Prager plasticity model. The test data are entered as tables of yield stress values versus equivalent plastic
strain at different equivalent plastic strain rates. The yield stress must be given as a function of the equivalent
plastic strain and, if required, of temperature and of other predeﬁned ﬁeld variables. In deﬁning this dependence
at ﬁnite strains, “true” (Cauchy) stress and log strain values should be used. The hardening curve at each
temperature must always start at zero plastic strain. For perfect plasticity only one yield stress, with zero plastic
strain, should be deﬁned at each temperature. It is possible to deﬁne the material to be strain softening as well
as strain hardening. The work hardening data are repeated as often as needed to deﬁne stress-strain curves at
different strain rates, starting with the static stress-strain curve and followed by curves corresponding to increasing
values of strain rate. The yield stress at a given strain and strain rate is interpolated directly from these tables.

potential);

“Guidelines and Procedures for Design of Class 1 Elevated Temperature Nuclear System Components”; these rules
are exercised by means of a constitutive model developed by Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL – Oak Ridge
National Laboratory Constitutive Model);
•
can be used in combination with creep strain rate control in analyses in which the creep strain rate must be kept
within a certain range; and
•
can potentially result in errors in calculated creep strains if anisotropic creep and plasticity occur simultaneously
(discussed below).

Creep Behavior
Creep behavior is speciﬁed by the equivalent uniaxial behavior—the creep “law.” In practical cases, creep laws
are typically of very complex form to ﬁt experimental data; therefore, the laws are deﬁned with user subroutine
CREEP, as discussed below. Alternatively, ﬁve common creep laws are provided in Abaqus/Standard: the power
law, the hyperbolic-sine law, the double power law, the Anand law, and the Darveaux law. These standard creep
laws are used for modeling secondary or steady-state creep. Creep is deﬁned by including creep behavior in the
material model deﬁnition (Material Data Deﬁnition). Alternatively, creep can be deﬁned in conjunction with
gasket behavior to deﬁne the rate-dependent behavior of a gasket.

Choosing a Creep Model
The power law creep model is attractive for its simplicity. However, it is limited in its range of application. The
time-hardening version of the power law creep model is typically recommended only in cases when the stress
state remains essentially constant. The strain-hardening version of power law creep should be used when the
stress state varies during an analysis. In the case where the stress is constant and there are no temperature or
ﬁeld dependencies, the time-hardening and strain-hardening versions of the power creep law are equivalent. For
either version of the power law, the stresses should be relatively low.
In regions of high stress, such as around a crack tip, the creep strain rates frequently show an exponential
dependence of stress. The hyperbolic-sine creep law shows exponential dependence on the stress, , at high
stress levels (
, where 
 is the yield stress) and reduces to the power law at low stress levels (with no
explicit time dependence).
The double power, Anand, and Darveaux models are particularly well suited for modeling the behavior of solder
alloys used in electronic packaging and have been shown to produce accurate results for a wide range of
temperatures and strain rates.
None of the above models is suitable for modeling creep under cyclic loading. The ORNL model (ORNL – Oak
Ridge National Laboratory Constitutive Model) is an empirical model for stainless steel that gives approximate
results for cyclic loading without having to perform the cyclic loading numerically. Generally, creep models for
cyclic loading are complicated and must be added to a model with user subroutine CREEP or with user subroutine
UMAT.

Rate-Dependent Plasticity: Creep and Swelling

Modeling Simultaneous Creep and Plasticity
If creep and plasticity occur simultaneously and implicit creep integration is in effect, both behaviors might
interact and a coupled system of constitutive equations needs to be solved. If creep and plasticity are isotropic,
Abaqus/Standard properly takes into account such coupled behavior, even if the elasticity is anisotropic. However,
if either creep or plasticity are anisotropic, Abaqus/Standard integrates the creep equations without taking
plasticity into account, which might lead to substantial errors in the creep strains. This situation develops only
if plasticity and creep are active at the same time, such as would occur during a long-term load increase; you
would not expect to have a problem if there is a short-term preloading phase in which plasticity dominates,
followed by a creeping phase in which no further yielding occurs. Integration of the creep laws and rate-dependent
plasticity are discussed in Rate-dependent metal plasticity (creep).
Time Power Law and Power Law Models
The time power law and power law models described below are equivalent to the “time hardening” and the
“strain hardening” forms but avoid their drawbacks. The time power law and power law models rewrite the laws
in such a way that the typical parameter values do not cause numerical difﬁculties. In addition, the units of all
the parameters are physical, which makes unit conversion easier if it is required.
Time Power Law Model
The time power law model has the following form:
where  is Mises equivalent stress or Hill's anisotropic equivalent deviatoric stress according to whether isotropic
or anisotropic creep behavior is deﬁned and 
, , 
, and 
 are material parameters.
The model is equivalent to the “time hardening” form. It is recommended that you use the time power law model
when the value of the parameter  is very small (
). In this case the equivalent time power law model
is obtained by setting 
, keeping the parameters  and 
 unchanged, and setting 
 to an arbitrary
value greater than zero (typically, 
 is set to one).

Numerical Difficulties
Depending on the choice of units for either form, the value of A might be very small for typical creep strain rates.
If A is less than 10−27, numerical difﬁculties can cause errors in the material calculations. Therefore, use another
system of units or use the time power law or power law model (described below) to avoid such difﬁculties in
the calculation of creep strain increments.
Time-Dependent Behavior
In the “time hardening” form and the time power law model, the total time or the creep time can be used. The
total time is the accumulated time over all general analysis steps. The creep time is the sum of the times of the
procedures with time-dependent material behavior. If the total time is used, it is recommended that small step
times compared to the creep time be used for any steps for which creep is not active in an analysis; this is
necessary to avoid changes in hardening behavior in subsequent steps.

Integration
Explicit integration, implicit integration, or both integration schemes can be used in a creep analysis, depending
on the procedure used, the parameters speciﬁed for the procedure, the presence of plasticity, and whether or not
geometric nonlinearity is requested.
Application of Explicit and Implicit Schemes
Nonlinear creep problems are often solved efﬁciently by forward-difference integration of the inelastic strains
(the “initial strain” method). This explicit method is computationally efﬁcient because, unlike implicit methods,
iteration is not required. Although this method is only conditionally stable, the numerical stability limit of the
explicit operator is usually sufﬁciently large to allow the solution to be developed in a small number of time
increments.
Abaqus/Standard uses either an explicit or an implicit integration scheme or switches from explicit to implicit
in the same step. These schemes are outlined ﬁrst, followed by a description of which procedures use these
integration schemes.
1. Integration scheme 1: Starts with explicit integration and switches to implicit integration based on either
stability or if plasticity is active. The stability limit used in explicit integration is discussed in the next section.
2. Integration scheme 2: Starts with explicit integration and switches to implicit integration when plasticity is
active. The stability criterion does not play a role here.
3. Integration scheme 3: Always uses implicit integration.
The use of the above integration schemes is determined by the procedure type, your choice of the integration
type to be used, as well as whether or not geometric nonlinearity is requested. For quasi-static and coupled
temperature-displacement procedures, if you do not choose an integration type, integration scheme 1 is used for
a geometrically linear analysis and integration scheme 3 is used for a geometrically nonlinear analysis. You can
force Abaqus/Standard to use explicit integration for creep and swelling effects in coupled
temperature-displacement or quasi-static procedures, when plasticity is not active throughout the step (integration
scheme 2). Explicit integration can be used regardless of whether or not geometric nonlinearity has been requested
(see General and Perturbation Procedures).
For a transient soils consolidation procedure, the implicit integration scheme (integration scheme 3) is always
used, irrespective of whether a geometrically linear or nonlinear analysis is performed.
Use one of the following options to restrict Abaqus/Standard to using explicit
integration:

Automatic Monitoring of Stability Limit during Explicit Integration
Abaqus/Standard monitors the stability limit automatically during explicit integration. If, at any point in the
model, the creep strain increment 
 is larger than the total elastic strain, the problem will become
unstable. Therefore, a stable time step, 
, is calculated every increment by
where 
 is the equivalent total elastic strain at time t, the beginning of the increment, and 
 is the equivalent
creep strain rate at time t. Furthermore,
where 
 is the Mises stress at time t, and
where
is the gradient of the deviatoric stress potential,
is the elasticity matrix, and
is an effective elastic modulus—for isotropic elasticity 
 can be approximated by Young's modulus.
At every increment for which explicit integration is performed, the stable time increment, 
, is compared to
the critical time increment, 
, which is calculated as follows:
259
Abaqus Materials Guide
Rate-Dependent Plasticity: Creep and Swelling

The quantity errtol is an error tolerance that you deﬁne as discussed below. If 
 is less than 
, 
 is used
as the time increment, which would mean that the stability criterion was limiting the size of the time step further
than required by accuracy considerations. Abaqus/Standard will automatically switch to the backward difference
operator (the implicit method, which is unconditionally stable) if 
 is less than 
 for nine consecutive
increments, you have not restricted Abaqus/Standard to explicit integration as discussed above, and there is
sufﬁcient time left in the analysis (time left 
). The stiffness matrix will be reformed at every iteration
if the implicit algorithm is used.
Specifying the Tolerance for Automatic Incrementation
The integration tolerance must be chosen so that increments in stress, 
, are calculated accurately. Consider
a one-dimensional example. The stress increment, 
, is
where 
, 
, and 
 are the uniaxial elastic, total, and creep strain increments, respectively, and E is the
elastic modulus. For 
 to be calculated accurately, the error in the creep strain increment, 
, must be small
compared to 
; that is,
Measuring the error in 
 as
leads to
You deﬁne errtol for the applicable procedure by choosing an acceptable stress error tolerance and dividing this
by a typical elastic modulus; therefore, it should be a small fraction of the ratio of the typical stress and the
effective elastic modulus in a problem. It is important to recognize that this approach for selecting a value for
errtol is often very conservative, and acceptable solutions can usually be obtained with higher values.

Loading Control Using Creep Strain Rate
In superplastic forming a controllable pressure is applied to deform a body. Superplastic materials can deform
to very large strains, provided that the strain rates of the deformation are maintained within very tight tolerances.
The objective of the superplastic analysis is to predict how the pressure must be controlled to form the component
as fast as possible without exceeding a superplastic strain rate anywhere in the material.
To achieve this using Abaqus/Standard, the controlling algorithm is as follows. During an increment
Abaqus/Standard calculates 
, the maximum value of the ratio of the equivalent creep strain rate to the target
creep strain rate for any integration point in a speciﬁed element set. If 
 is less than 0.2 or greater than 3.0
in a given increment, the increment is abandoned and restarted with the following load modiﬁcations:
where p is the new load magnitude and 
 is the old load magnitude. If 
, the increment is
accepted; and at the beginning of the following time increment, the load magnitudes are modiﬁed as follows:
When you activate the above algorithm, the loading in a creep and/or swelling problem can be controlled on the
basis of the maximum equivalent creep strain rate found in a deﬁned element set. As a minimum requirement,
this method is used to deﬁne a target equivalent creep strain rate; however, if required, it can also be used to
deﬁne the target creep strain rate as a function of equivalent creep strain (measured as log strain), temperature,
and other predeﬁned ﬁeld variables. The creep strain dependency curve at each temperature must always start
at zero equivalent creep strain.
A solution-dependent amplitude is used to deﬁne the minimum and maximum limits of the loading (see Deﬁning
a Solution-Dependent Amplitude for Superplastic Forming Analysis). Any number or combination of loads can
be used. The current value of 
 is available for output as discussed below.

• *ANNEAL TEMPERATURE
• Specifying the annealing temperature of an elastic-plastic material
Overview
This capability:
•
is intended to model the effects of melting and resolidiﬁcation in metals subjected to high-temperature processes
or the effects of annealing at a material point when its temperature rises above a certain level;
•
is available for only the Mises, Johnson-Cook, and Hill plasticity models;
•
is intended to be used in conjunction with appropriate temperature-dependent material properties (in particular, the
model assumes perfectly plastic behavior at or above the annealing or melting temperature); and
•
can be modeled simply by deﬁning an annealing or melting temperature.
Effects of Annealing or Melting
When the temperature of a material point exceeds a user-speciﬁed value called the annealing temperature, Abaqus
assumes that the material point loses its hardening memory. The effect of prior work hardening is removed by
setting the equivalent plastic strain to zero. For kinematic and combined hardening models the backstress tensor
is also reset to zero. If the temperature of the material point falls below the annealing temperature at a subsequent
point in time, the material point can work harden again. Depending on the temperature history a material point
may lose and accumulate memory several times, which in the context of modeling melting would correspond
to repeated melting and resolidiﬁcation. Any accumulated material damage is not healed when the annealing
temperature is reached. Damage will continue to accumulate after annealing according to any damage model in
effect (see About Damage and Failure for Ductile Metals).
In Abaqus/Explicit an annealing step can be deﬁned to simulate the annealing process for the entire model,
independent of temperature; see Annealing for details.
Material Properties
The annealing temperature is a material property that can optionally be deﬁned as a function of ﬁeld variables.
This material property must be used in conjunction with an appropriate deﬁnition of material properties as
functions of temperature for the Mises plasticity model. In particular, the hardening behavior must be deﬁned
as a function of temperature and zero hardening must be speciﬁed at or above the annealing temperature. In
general, hardening receives contributions from two sources. The ﬁrst source of hardening can be classiﬁed
broadly as static, and its effect is measured by the rate of change of the yield stress with respect to the plastic
strain at a ﬁxed strain rate. The second source of hardening can be classiﬁed broadly as rate dependent, and its
effect is measured by the rate of change of the yield stress with respect to the strain rate at a ﬁxed plastic strain.
For the Mises plasticity model, if the material data that describe hardening (both static and rate-dependent
contributions) are completely speciﬁed through tabular input of yield stress versus plastic strain at different
263
Annealing or Melting

values of the strain rate (see Rate-Dependent Yield), the (temperature-dependent) static part of the hardening at
each strain rate is speciﬁed by deﬁning several yield stress versus plastic strain curves (each at a different
temperature). For metals the yield stress at a ﬁxed strain rate typically decreases with increasing temperature.
Abaqus expects the hardening at each strain rate to vanish at or above the annealing temperature and issues an
error message if you specify otherwise in the material deﬁnition. Zero (static) hardening can be speciﬁed by
simply specifying a single data point (at zero plastic strain) in the yield stress versus plastic strain curve at or
above the annealing temperature. In addition, you must also ensure that at or above the annealing temperature,
the yield stress does not vary with the strain rate. This can be accomplished by specifying the same value of
yield stress at all values of strain rate in the single data point approach discussed above.
Alternatively, the static part of the hardening can be deﬁned at zero strain rate, and the rate-dependent part can
be deﬁned utilizing the overstress power law (see Rate-Dependent Yield). In that case, zero static hardening at
or above the annealing temperature can be speciﬁed by specifying a single data point (at zero plastic strain) in
the yield stress versus plastic strain curve at or above the annealing temperature. The overstress power law
parameters can also be appropriately selected to ensure that at or above the annealing temperature the yield stress
does not vary with strain rate. This can be accomplished by selecting a large value for the parameter 
 (relative
to the static yield stress) and setting the parameter 
.
For hardening deﬁned in Abaqus/Standard with user subroutine UHARD, Abaqus/Standard checks the hardening
slope at or above the annealing temperature during the actual computations and issues an error message if
appropriate.
The Johnson-Cook plasticity model in Abaqus/Explicit requires a separate melting temperature to deﬁne the
hardening behavior. If the annealing temperature is deﬁned to be less than the melting temperature speciﬁed for
the metal plasticity model, the hardening memory is removed at the annealing temperature and the melting
temperature is used strictly to deﬁne the hardening function. Otherwise, the hardening memory is removed
automatically at the melting temperature.

Yield and Creep Stress Ratios
Anisotropic yield or creep behavior using quadratic Hill's potential is modeled through the use of yield or creep
stress ratios, 
. In the case of anisotropic yield the yield ratios are deﬁned with respect to a reference yield
stress, 
 (given for the metal plasticity deﬁnition), such that if 
 is applied as the only nonzero stress, the
corresponding yield stress is 
. The plastic ﬂow rule is deﬁned below.
In the case of anisotropic creep the 
 are creep ratios used to scale the stress value when the creep strain rate
is calculated. Thus, if 
 is the only nonzero stress, the equivalent stress, , used in the user-deﬁned creep law
is 
.
Yield and creep stress ratios can be deﬁned as constants or as tabular functions of temperature and predeﬁned
ﬁeld variables. A local orientation must be used to deﬁne the direction of anisotropy (see Orientations).

Defining Anisotropic Yield Behavior on the Basis of Strain Ratios (Lankford's r-Values)
As discussed above, Hill's anisotropic plasticity potential is deﬁned in Abaqus from user input consisting of
ratios of yield stress in different directions with respect to a reference stress. However, in some cases, such as
sheet metal forming applications, it is common to ﬁnd the anisotropic material data given in terms of ratios of
width strain to thickness strain. Mathematical relationships are then necessary to convert the strain ratios to stress
ratios that can be input into Abaqus.
In sheet metal forming applications, we are generally concerned with plane stress conditions. Consider 
 to
be the “rolling” and “cross” directions in the plane of the sheet; z is the thickness direction. From a design
viewpoint, the type of anisotropy usually desired is that in which the sheet is isotropic in the plane and has an
increased strength in the thickness direction, which is normally referred to as transverse anisotropy. Another
type of anisotropy is characterized by different strengths in different directions in the plane of the sheet, which
is called planar anisotropy.
In a simple tension test performed in the x-direction in the plane of the sheet, the ﬂow rule for this potential
(given above) deﬁnes the incremental strain ratios (assuming small elastic strains) as
Therefore, the ratio of width to thickness strain, often referred to as Lankford's r-value, is
Similarly, for a simple tension test performed in the y-direction in the plane of the sheet, the incremental strain
ratios are

General Anisotropy
Thus far, we have only considered loading applied along the axes of anisotropy. To derive a more general
anisotropic model in plane stress, the sheet must be loaded in one other direction in its plane. Suppose we perform
a simple tension test at an angle  to the x-direction; then, from equilibrium considerations we can write the
nonzero stress components as
where  is the applied tensile stress. Substituting these values in the ﬂow equations and assuming small elastic
strains yields
Assuming small geometrical changes, the width strain increment (the increment of strain at right angles to the
direction of loading, ) is written as

Progressive Damage and Failure
In Abaqus/Explicit Hill anisotropic yield can be used in conjunction with the models of progressive damage and
failure discussed in About Damage and Failure for Ductile Metals. The capability allows for the speciﬁcation
of one or more damage initiation criteria, including ductile, shear, forming limit diagram (FLD), forming limit
stress diagram (FLSD), and Müschenborn-Sonne forming limit diagram (MSFLD) criteria. After damage initiation,
the material stiffness is degraded progressively according to the speciﬁed damage evolution response. The model
offers two failure choices, including the removal of elements from the mesh as a result of tearing or ripping of
the structure. The progressive damage models allow for a smooth degradation of the material stiffness, making
them suitable for both quasi-static and dynamic situations.

If you include annealing behavior in the material deﬁnition and the annealing temperature is deﬁned to be less
than the melting temperature speciﬁed for the metal plasticity model, the hardening memory will be removed
at the annealing temperature and the melting temperature will be used strictly to deﬁne the hardening function.
Otherwise, the hardening memory will be removed automatically at the melting temperature. If the temperature
of the material point falls below the annealing temperature at a subsequent point in time, the material point can
work harden again. For more details, see Annealing or Melting.

Johnson-Cook Dynamic Failure
Abaqus/Explicit provides a dynamic failure model speciﬁcally for the Johnson-Cook plasticity model, which is
suitable only for high-strain-rate deformation of metals. This model is referred to as the “Johnson-Cook dynamic
failure model.” Abaqus/Explicit also offers a more general implementation of the Johnson-Cook failure model
as part of the family of damage initiation criteria, which is the recommended technique for modeling progressive
damage and failure of materials (see About Damage and Failure for Ductile Metals). The Johnson-Cook dynamic
failure model is based on the value of the equivalent plastic strain at element integration points; failure is assumed
to occur when the damage parameter exceeds 1. The damage parameter, , is deﬁned as
281
Abaqus Materials Guide
Johnson-Cook Plasticity

where 
 is an increment of the equivalent plastic strain, 
 is the strain at failure, and the summation is
performed over all increments in the analysis. The strain at failure, 
, is assumed to be dependent on a
nondimensional plastic strain rate, 
; a dimensionless pressure-deviatoric stress ratio, 
 (where p is the
pressure stress and q is the Mises stress); and the nondimensional temperature, , deﬁned earlier in the
Johnson-Cook hardening model. The dependencies are assumed to be separable and are of the form
where 
–
 are failure parameters measured at or below the transition temperature, 
, and

reference strain rate. You provide the values of 
–
 when you deﬁne the Johnson-Cook dynamic failure model.
This expression for 
 differs from the original formula published by Johnson and Cook (1985) in the sign of
the parameter 
. This difference is motivated by the fact that most materials experience an increase in 
 with
increasing pressure-deviatoric stress ratio; therefore, 
 in the above expression will usually take positive values.
When this failure criterion is met, the deviatoric stress components are set to zero and remain zero for the rest
of the analysis. Depending on your choice, the pressure stress may also be set to zero for the rest of calculation
(if this is the case, you must specify element deletion and the element will be deleted) or it may be required to
remain compressive for the rest of the calculation (if this is the case, you must choose not to use element deletion).
By default, the elements that meet the failure criterion are deleted.
The Johnson-Cook dynamic failure model is suitable for high-strain-rate deformation of metals; therefore, it is
most applicable to truly dynamic situations. For quasi-static problems that require element removal, the progressive
damage and failure models (Progressive Damage and Failure) or the Gurson metal plasticity model (Porous
Metal Plasticity) are recommended.
The use of the Johnson-Cook dynamic failure model requires the use of Johnson-Cook hardening but does not
necessarily require the use of Johnson-Cook strain rate dependence. However, the rate-dependent term in the
Johnson-Cook dynamic failure criterion will be included only if Johnson-Cook strain rate dependence is deﬁned.
The Johnson-Cook damage initiation criterion described in Damage Initiation for Ductile Metals does not have
these limitations.

Abaqus allows for an adiabatic thermal-stress analysis (Adiabatic Analysis), a fully coupled
temperature-displacement analysis (Fully Coupled Thermal-Stress Analysis), or a fully coupled
thermal-electrical-structural analysis (Fully Coupled Thermal-Electrical-Structural Analysis) to be performed
in which heat generated by plastic straining of a material is calculated. This method is typically used in the
simulation of bulk metal forming or high-speed manufacturing processes involving large amounts of inelastic
strain, where the heating of the material caused by its deformation is an important effect because of temperature
dependence of the material properties. Since the Johnson-Cook plasticity model is motivated by high-strain-rate
transient dynamic applications, temperature change in this model is generally computed by assuming adiabatic
conditions (no heat transfer between elements). Heat is generated in an element by plastic work, and the resulting
temperature rise is computed using the speciﬁc heat of the material.
This effect is introduced by deﬁning the fraction of the rate of inelastic dissipation that appears as a heat ﬂux
per volume.

Overview
The progressive damage and failure models described in About Damage and Failure for Ductile Metals are the
recommended method for modeling material damage and failure in Abaqus; these models are suitable for both quasi-static
and dynamic situations. Abaqus/Explicit offers two additional element failure models suitable only for high-strain-rate
dynamic problems. The shear failure model is driven by plastic yielding. The tensile failure model is driven by tensile
loading. These failure models can be used to limit subsequent load-carrying capacity of an element (up to the point of
removing the element) once a stress limit is reached. Both models can be used for the same material.
The shear failure model:
•

Dynamic Failure Models

Shear Failure Model
The shear failure model can be used in conjunction with the Mises or the Johnson-Cook plasticity models in
Abaqus/Explicit to deﬁne shear failure of the material.
Shear Failure Criterion
The shear failure model is based on the value of the equivalent plastic strain at element integration points; failure
is assumed to occur when the damage parameter exceeds 1. The damage parameter, , is deﬁned as
where 
 is any initial value of the equivalent plastic strain, 
 is an increment of the equivalent plastic strain,
 is the strain at failure, and the summation is performed over all increments in the analysis.
The strain at failure, 
, is assumed to depend on the plastic strain rate, 
; a dimensionless pressure-deviatoric
stress ratio, 
 (where p is the pressure stress and q is the Mises stress); temperature; and predeﬁned ﬁeld
variables. There are two ways to deﬁne the strain at failure, 
. One is to use direct tabular data, where the
dependencies are given in a tabular form. Alternatively, the analytical form proposed by Johnson and Cook can
be invoked (see Johnson-Cook Plasticity for more details).
When direct tabular data are used to deﬁne the shear failure model, the strain at failure, 
, must be given as a
tabular function of the equivalent plastic strain rate, the pressure-deviatoric stress ratio, temperature, and predeﬁned
ﬁeld variables. This method requires the use of the Mises plasticity model.
For the Johnson-Cook shear failure model, you must specify the failure parameters, 
–
 (see Johnson-Cook
Plasticity for more details on these parameters). The shear failure data must be calibrated at or below the transition
temperature, 
, deﬁned in Johnson-Cook Plasticity. This method requires the use of the Johnson-Cook
plasticity model.
Use both of the following options for the Mises plasticity model:
Input File Usage:
*PLASTIC, HARDENING=ISOTROPIC
*SHEAR FAILURE, TYPE=TABULAR
Use both of the following options for the Johnson-Cook plasticity model:
*PLASTIC, HARDENING=JOHNSON COOK

Abaqus/CAE Usage:
Element Removal
When the shear failure criterion is met at an integration point, all the stress components are set to zero and that
material point fails. An element is deleted (or removed) from a mesh upon material failure. Details for element
deletion driven by material failure are described in Material Failure and Element Deletion. The status of a
Abaqus Materials Guide
286
Dynamic Failure Models

material point and an element can be determined by requesting output variables STATUSMP and STATUS,
respectively. Element deletion is the default failure choice.
An alternative failure choice, where the element is not deleted, is to specify that when the shear failure criterion
is met at a material point, the deviatoric stress components are set to zero for that point and remain zero for the
rest of the calculation. The pressure stress is then required to remain compressive; that is, if a negative pressure
stress is computed in a failed material point in an increment, it is reset to zero. This failure choice is not allowed
when using plane stress, shell, membrane, beam, pipe, and truss elements because the structural constraints may
be violated.
Use the following option to allow element deletion when the failure criterion is met
(the default):
Input File Usage:
*SHEAR FAILURE, ELEMENT DELETION=YES
Use the following option to allow the element to take hydrostatic compressive stress
only when the failure criterion is met:

Determining When to Use the Shear Failure Model
The shear failure model in Abaqus/Explicit is suitable for high-strain-rate dynamic problems where inertia is
important. Improper use of the shear failure model may result in an incorrect simulation.
For quasi-static problems that may require element removal, the progressive damage and failure models
(Progressive Damage and Failure) or the Gurson porous metal plasticity model (Porous Metal Plasticity) are
recommended.
Tensile Failure Model
The tensile failure model can be used in conjunction with either the Mises or the Johnson-Cook plasticity models
or the equation of state material model in Abaqus/Explicit to deﬁne tensile failure of the material.
Tensile Failure Criterion
The Abaqus/Explicit tensile failure model uses the hydrostatic pressure stress as a failure measure to model
dynamic spall or a pressure cutoff. The tensile failure criterion assumes that failure occurs when the pressure
stress, p, becomes more tensile than the user-speciﬁed hydrostatic cutoff stress, 
. The hydrostatic cutoff
stress may be a function of temperature and predeﬁned ﬁeld variables. There is no default value for this stress.
The tensile failure model can be used with either the Mises or the Johnson-Cook plasticity models or the equation
of state material model.

Failure Choices
When the tensile failure criterion is met at an element integration point, the material point fails. Five failure
choices are offered for the failed material points: the default choice, which includes element removal, and four
different spall models. These failure choices are described below.
Element Removal
When the tensile failure criterion is met at an integration point, all the stress components are set to zero and that
material point fails. By default, an element is deleted (or removed) from a mesh upon material failure. Details
for element deletion driven by material failure are described in Material Failure and Element Deletion. The
status of a material point and an element can be determined by requesting output variables STATUSMP and

Spall Models
An alternative failure choice that is based on spall (the crumbling of a material), rather than element removal,
is also available. Four failure combinations are available in this category. When the tensile failure criterion is
met at a material point, the deviatoric stress components may be unaffected or may be required to be zero, and
the pressure stress may be limited by the hydrostatic cutoff stress or may be required to be compressive. Therefore,
there are four possible failure combinations (see Figure 1, where “O” is the stress that would exist if the tensile
failure model were not used).

which the deviatoric stress components are unaffected and the pressure stress is limited by the hydrostatic

.
•
Ductile shear and brittle pressure: this choice corresponds to point 4 in Figure 1 and models the case in which
the deviatoric stress components are unaffected and the pressure stress is required to be compressive; that

There is no default failure combination for the spall models. If you choose not to use the element deletion model,
you must specify the failure combination explicitly. If the material's deviatoric behavior is not deﬁned (for
example, the equation of state model without deviatoric behavior is used), the deviatoric part of the combination
is meaningless and will be ignored. The spall models are not allowed when using plane stress, shell, membrane,
beam, pipe, and truss elements.

Dynamic Failure Models

Using the Failure Models with Rebar
It is possible to use the shear failure and/or the tensile failure models in elements for which rebars are also
deﬁned. When such elements fail according to the failure criterion, the base material contribution to the element
stress-carrying capacity is removed or adjusted depending on the type of failure chosen, but the rebar contribution
to the element stress-carrying capacity is not removed. However, if you also include failure in the rebar material
deﬁnition, the rebar contribution to the element stress-carrying capacity will also be removed or adjusted if the
failure criterion speciﬁed for the rebar is met.
Elements
The shear and tensile failure models with element deletion can be used with any elements in Abaqus/Explicit
that include mechanical behavior (elements that have displacement degrees of freedom). The shear and tensile
failure models without element deletion can be used only with plane strain, axisymmetric, and three-dimensional
solid (continuum) elements in Abaqus/Explicit.
Output
In addition to the standard output identiﬁers available in Abaqus/Explicit (Abaqus/Explicit Output Variable
Identiﬁers), the following variable has special meaning for the shear and tensile failure models:
Status of element (1.0 if the element is active, 0.0 if it is not).
STATUS

Overview
The porous metal plasticity model:
•
is used to model materials with a dilute concentration of voids in which the relative density is greater than 0.9;
•
is based on Gurson's porous metal plasticity theory (Gurson, 1977) with void nucleation and, in Abaqus/Explicit,
a failure deﬁnition; and
•
deﬁnes the inelastic ﬂow of the porous metal on the basis of a potential function that characterizes the porosity in
terms of a single state variable, the relative density.
Elastic and Plastic Behavior
You specify the elastic part of the response separately; only linear isotropic elasticity can be speciﬁed (see Linear
Elastic Behavior). The porous metal plasticity model cannot be used in conjunction with porous elasticity (Elastic
Behavior of Porous Materials).
You specify the hardening behavior of the fully dense matrix material by deﬁning a metal plasticity model (see
Classical Metal Plasticity). Only isotropic hardening can be speciﬁed. The hardening curve must describe the
yield stress of the matrix material as a function of plastic strain in the matrix material. In deﬁning this dependence
at ﬁnite strains, “true” (Cauchy) stress and log strain values should be given. Rate dependency effects for the
matrix material can be modeled (see Rate-Dependent Yield).
Yield Condition
The relative density of a material, r, is deﬁned as the ratio of the volume of solid material to the total volume of
the material. The relationships deﬁning the model are expressed in terms of the void volume fraction, f, which
is deﬁned as the ratio of the volume of voids to the total volume of the material. It follows that 
 For
a metal containing a dilute concentration of voids, Gurson (1977) proposed a yield condition as a function of
the void volume fraction. This yield condition was later modiﬁed by Tvergaard (1981) to the form
where
291
Porous Metal Plasticity

is the deviatoric part of the Cauchy stress tensor ;
is the effective Mises stress;
is the hydrostatic pressure;
is the yield stress of the fully dense matrix material as a function of 
, the equivalent plastic strain in
the matrix; and
,
,
are material parameters.
The Cauchy stress is deﬁned as the force per “current unit area,” comprised of voids and the solid (matrix)
material.
f = 0 (r = 1) implies that the material is fully dense, and the Gurson yield condition reduces to the Mises yield
condition. f = 1 (r = 0) implies that the material is completely voided and has no stress carrying capacity. The
model generally gives physically reasonable results only for 
0.1 (
0.9).
The model is described in detail in Porous metal plasticity, along with a discussion of its numerical
implementation.
If the porous metal plasticity model is used during a pore pressure analysis (see Coupled Pore Fluid Diffusion
and Stress Analysis), the relative density, r, is tracked independently of the void ratio.
Specifying q1, q2, and q3
You specify the parameters 
, 
, and 
 directly for the porous metal plasticity model. For typical metals the
ranges of the parameters reported in the literature are 
 = 1.0 to 1.5, 
 = 1.0, and 
 = 
 = 1.0 to 2.25 (see
Necking of a round tensile bar). The original Gurson model is recovered when 
 = 
 = 
 = 1.0. You can deﬁne
these parameters as tabular functions of temperature and/or ﬁeld variables.

Overview
The cast iron plasticity model:
•
is intended for the constitutive modeling of gray cast iron;
•
provides elastic-plastic behavior with different yield strengths, ﬂow, and hardening in tension and compression;
•
is based on a yield function that depends on the maximum principal stress under tensile loading conditions and
pressure-independent (von Mises type) behavior under compressive loading conditions;
•
allows for simultaneous inelastic dilatation and inelastic shearing under tensile loading conditions;
•
allows only inelastic shearing under compressive loading conditions;
•
is intended for the simulation of material response only under essentially monotonic loading conditions; and
•
cannot be used to model rate dependence.
Elastic and Plastic Behavior
The cast iron plasticity model describes the mechanical behavior of gray cast iron, a material with a microstructure
consisting of a distribution of graphite ﬂakes in a steel matrix. In tension the graphite ﬂakes act as stress
concentrators, resulting in yielding as a function of the maximum principal stress, followed by brittle behavior.
In compression the graphite ﬂakes do not have an appreciable effect on the macroscopic response, resulting in
a ductile behavior similar to that of many steels.
You specify the elastic part of the response separately; only linear isotropic elasticity can be used (see Linear
Elastic Behavior). The elastic stiffness is assumed to be the same under tension and compression.
The cast iron plasticity model is used to provide the value of the plastic “Poisson's ratio,” which is the absolute
value of the ratio of the transverse to the longitudinal plastic strain under uniaxial tension. The plastic Poisson's
ratio can vary with the plastic deformation. However, the model in Abaqus assumes that it is constant with
respect to plastic deformation. It can depend on temperature and ﬁeld variables. If no value is speciﬁed for the
plastic Poisson's ratio, a default value of 0.04 is assumed. This default value is based on experimental results for
permanent volumetric strain under uniaxial tension (see Cast iron plasticity for details).
Independent hardening (see Figure 1) of the material under tension and compression can be speciﬁed as described
below. The tension hardening data provide the uniaxial tension yield stress as a function of plastic strain,

Yield Condition
Abaqus makes use of a composite yield surface to describe the different behavior in tension and compression.
In tension yielding is assumed to be governed by the maximum principal stress, while in compression yielding
is assumed to be pressure independent and governed by the deviatoric stresses alone (Mises yield condition).
The model is described in detail in Cast iron plasticity.
Flow Rule
For the purposes of discussing the ﬂow and hardening behavior, it is useful to divide the meridional plane into

The region to the left of the uniaxial compression line (labeled UC) is referred to as the “tensile region,” while
the region to the right of the uniaxial compression line is referred to as the “compressive region.” The ﬂow
potential consists of the Mises cylinder in the compressive region and an ellipsoidal “cap” in the tensile region.
The transition between the two surfaces is smooth. The projection of the ﬂow potential on the meridional plane
(see Figure 2) consists of a straight line in the compressive region and an ellipse in the tensile region. The
corresponding projection on the deviatoric plane is a circle. A consequence of the above choice is that plastic
ﬂow results in inelastic volume expansion in the tensile region and no inelastic volume change in the compressive
region (see Cast iron plasticity for details).
Nonassociated Flow
Since the ﬂow potential is different from the yield surface (“nonassociated” ﬂow), the material Jacobian matrix
is unsymmetric. Hence, to improve convergence, use the unsymmetric matrix storage and solution scheme (see
Deﬁning an Analysis).
Hardening
Since the hardening of gray cast iron is different in uniaxial tension and uniaxial compression, you need to
provide two sets of hardening data in tabular form: one based on a uniaxial tension experiment that deﬁnes
 and the other based on a uniaxial compression experiment that deﬁnes 
.
Here, 
 and 
 are the equivalent plastic strains in uniaxial tension and uniaxial compression, respectively.

Restrictions on Material Data
The plastic Poisson's ratio, 
, is expected to be less than 0.5 since experimental results suggest that there is a
permanent increase in the volume of gray cast iron when it is loaded in uniaxial tension beyond yield. For the
potential to be well-deﬁned, 
 must be greater than −1.0. Thus, the plastic Poisson's ratio must satisfy −1.0
 0.5.
The cast iron plasticity material model is intended for modeling cast iron and other materials like cast iron for
which the behavior in uniaxial tension and uniaxial compression matches the behavior shown in Figure 1. In
particular, the model expects the initial yield stress in uniaxial tension to be less than the initial yield stress in
uniaxial compression. Even if the overall stress-strain response and hardening behavior in uniaxial stress states
of some material other than cast iron is consistent with that of cast iron, you must also ensure that the ﬂow
potential (which has been constructed speciﬁcally for modeling cast iron) for the model is meaningful for other
materials. Abaqus issues a warning message only if the initial yield stress in uniaxial tension is equal to or greater
than that in uniaxial compression. No other checks are carried out in this regard.
If the yield stress in uniaxial tension is higher than that in uniaxial compression, a material point in uniaxial
tension may actually yield at the initial yield stress speciﬁed for uniaxial compression. This apparent anomalous
behavior is due to the fact that (as a result of unrealistic user-speciﬁed material properties) a uniaxial tension
stressing path in stress space meets the compressive (Mises) part of the yield surface ﬁrst.
Elements
The cast iron plasticity model can be used with any stress/displacement element in Abaqus other than elements
for which the assumed stress state is plane stress (plane stress continuum, shell, and membrane elements). It can
be used with one-dimensional elements (trusses and beams in a plane) and, in Abaqus/Standard, with beams in
space.

Overview
The two-layer viscoplastic model:
•
is intended for modeling materials in which signiﬁcant time-dependent behavior as well as plasticity is observed,
which for metals typically occurs at elevated temperatures;
•
consists of an elastic-plastic network that is in parallel with an elastic-viscous network (in contrast to the coupled
creep and plasticity capabilities in which the plastic and the viscous networks are in series);
•
is based on a Mises or Hill yield condition in the elastic-plastic network and any of the available creep models in
Abaqus/Standard (except the hyperbolic creep law) in the elastic-viscous network;
•
assumes a deviatoric inelastic response (hence, the pressure-dependent plasticity or creep models cannot be used
to deﬁne the behavior of the two networks);
•
is intended for modeling material response under ﬂuctuating loads over a wide range of temperatures; and
•
has been shown to provide good results for thermomechanical loading.
Material Behavior
The material behavior is broken down into three parts: elastic, plastic, and viscous. Figure 1 shows a
one-dimensional idealization of this material model, with the elastic-plastic and the elastic-viscous networks in
parallel. The following subsections describe the elastic and the inelastic (plastic and viscous) behavior in detail.

Elastic Behavior
The elastic part of the response for both networks is speciﬁed using a linear isotropic elasticity deﬁnition. Any
one of the available elasticity models in Abaqus/Standard can be used to deﬁne the elastic behavior of the
networks. Referring to the one-dimensional idealization (Figure 1), the ratio of the elastic modulus of the
elastic-viscous network (
) to the total (instantaneous) modulus (
) is given by
The user-speciﬁed ratio f, given as part of the viscous behavior deﬁnition as discussed later, apportions the total
moduli speciﬁed for the elastic behavior among the elastic-viscous and the elastic-plastic networks. As a result,
if isotropic elastic properties are deﬁned, the Poisson's ratios are the same in both networks. However, if anisotropic
elasticity is deﬁned, the same type of anisotropy holds for both networks. The properties speciﬁed for the elastic
behavior are assumed to be the instantaneous properties (
).

A plasticity deﬁnition can be used to provide the static hardening data for the material model. All available metal
plasticity models, including Hill's plasticity model to deﬁne anisotropic yield (Hill Anisotropic Yield/Creep),
can be used.
The elastic-plastic network does not take into account rate-dependent yield. Hence, any speciﬁcation of strain
rate dependence for the plasticity model is not allowed.

Viscous Behavior
The viscous behavior of the material can be governed by any of the available creep laws in Abaqus/Standard
(Rate-Dependent Plasticity: Creep and Swelling), except the hyperbolic creep law. When you deﬁne the viscous
behavior, you specify the viscosity parameters and choose the speciﬁc type of viscous behavior. If you choose
to input the creep law through user subroutine CREEP, only deviatoric creep should be deﬁned—more speciﬁcally,
volumetric swelling behavior should not be deﬁned within user subroutine CREEP. In addition, you also specify
the fraction, f, that deﬁnes the ratio of the elastic modulus of the elastic-viscous network to the total (instantaneous)
modulus. Viscous stress ratios can be speciﬁed under the viscous behavior deﬁnition to deﬁne anisotropic
viscosity (see Hill Anisotropic Yield/Creep).
All material properties can be speciﬁed as functions of temperature and predeﬁned ﬁeld variables.

Time-Dependent Behavior
In the “time hardening” power law model the total time or the creep time can be used. The total time is the
accumulated time over all general analysis steps. The creep time is the sum of the times of the procedures with
time-dependent material behavior. If the total time is used, it is recommended that small step times compared
to the creep time be used for any steps for which creep is not active in an analysis; this is necessary to avoid
changes in hardening behavior in subsequent steps.

Thermal Expansion
Thermal expansion can be modeled by providing the thermal expansion coefﬁcient of the material (Thermal
Expansion). Anisotropic expansion can be deﬁned in the usual manner. In the one-dimensional idealization the
expansion element is assumed to be in series with the rest of the network.
Calibration of Material Parameters
The calibration procedure is best explained in the context of the one-dimensional idealization of the material
model. In the following discussion the viscous behavior is assumed to be governed by the Norton-Hoff rate law,
which is given by
In the expression above the subscript V denotes quantities in the elastic-viscous network alone. This form of the
rate law may be chosen, for example, by choosing a time-hardening power law for the viscous behavior and
setting 
. For this basic case there are six material parameters that need to be calibrated (Figure 1). These
are the elastic properties of the two networks, 
 and 
; the initial yield stress 
; the hardening 
; and the
Norton-Hoff rate parameters, A and n.
The experiment that needs to be performed is uniaxial tension under different constant strain rates. A static
(effectively zero strain rate) uniaxial tension test determines the long-term modulus, 
; the initial yield stress,
; and the hardening, 
. The hardening is assumed to be linear for illustration purposes. The material model
is not limited to linear hardening, and any general hardening behavior can be deﬁned for the plasticity model.
The instantaneous elastic modulus, 
, can be measured by measuring the initial elastic response
of the material under nonzero, relatively high, strain rates. Several such measurements at different applied strain

rates can be compared until the instantaneous moduli does not change with a change in the applied strain rate.
The difference between K and 
 determines 
.
To calibrate the parameters A and n, it is useful to recognize that the long-term (steady-state) behavior of the
elastic-viscous network under a constant applied strain rate, 
, is a constant stress of magnitude 
.
Under the assumption that the hardening modulus is negligible compared to the elastic modulus (
),
the steady-state response of the overall material is given by
where  is the total stress for a given total strain . To determine whether steady state has been reached, one can
plot the quantity 
 as a function of  and note when it becomes a constant. The constant value
of  is equal to 
. By performing several tests at different values of the constant applied strain rate 
,
it is possible to determine the constants A and n.
Material Response in Different Analysis Steps
The material is active during all stress/displacement procedure types. In a static analysis step where the long-term
response is requested (see Static Stress Analysis), only the elastic-plastic network will be active; the elastic-viscous
network will not contribute in any manner. In particular, the stress in the viscous network will be zero during a
long-term static response. If the creep effects are removed in a coupled temperature-displacement procedure or
a soils consolidation procedure, the response of the elastic-viscous network will be assumed to be elastic only.
During a linear perturbation step, only the elastic response of the networks is considered.
Some stress/displacement procedure types (coupled temperature-displacement, soils consolidation, and quasi-static)
allow user control of the time integration accuracy of the viscous constitutive equations through a user-speciﬁed
error tolerance. In other procedure types where no such direct control is currently available (static, dynamic),
you must choose appropriate time increments. These time increments must be small compared to the typical
relaxation time of the material.
Elements
The two-layer viscoplastic model is not available for one-dimensional elements (beams and trusses). It can be
used with any other element in Abaqus/Standard that includes mechanical behavior (elements that have
displacement degrees of freedom).

elastic moduli.

Overview
The Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) constitutive model:
•
allows for use of the rules deﬁned in the Nuclear Standard NEF 9–5T, “Guidelines and Procedures for Design of
Class 1 Elevated Temperature Nuclear System Components,” in plasticity and creep calculations;
•
is intended for use in modeling types 304 and 316 stainless steel at relatively high temperatures;
•
can be used only with the metal plasticity models (linear kinematic hardening only) and/or the strain hardening
form of the metal creep law; and
•
is described in detail in ORNL constitutive theory.
Usage with Plasticity
The ORNL constitutive model in Abaqus/Standard is based on the March 1981 issue of the Nuclear Standard
NEF 9–5T and on the October 1986 issue, which revises the constitutive model extensively. This model adds
isotropic hardening of the plastic yield surface from a virgin material state to a fully cycled state. Initially the
material is assumed to harden kinematically according to a bilinear representation of the virgin stress-strain
curve. If a strain reversal takes place or if the creep strain reaches 0.2%, the yield surface expands isotropically
to the user-deﬁned tenth-cycle stress-strain curve. Further hardening occurs kinematically according to a bilinear
representation of the tenth-cycle stress-strain curve.
You must specify the virgin yield stress and the hardening through a plasticity model deﬁnition and the elastic
part of the response through a linear elasticity model deﬁnition. You specify the tenth-cycle yield stress and
hardening values separately. The yield stress at each temperature should be deﬁned by giving its value at zero
plastic strain and at one additional nonzero plastic strain point, thus giving a constant hardening rate (linear work
hardening).

ratio, but the nonlinear part of the behavior is incompressible (because the ﬂow is normal to the Mises stress
potential). The model is described in detail in Deformation plasticity.

Typical Applications
The deformation plasticity model is most commonly applied in static loading with small-displacement analysis,
where the fully plastic solution must be developed in a part of the model. Generally, the load is ramped on until
all points in the region being monitored satisfy the condition that the “plastic strain” dominates and, hence,
exhibit fully plastic behavior, which is deﬁned as

You can specify the name of a particular element set to be monitored in a static analysis step for fully plastic

speciﬁed for the static step is exceeded, whichever comes ﬁrst.

Overview
The extended Drucker-Prager models:
•
are used to model frictional materials, which are typically granular-like soils and rock, and exhibit pressure-dependent
yield (the material becomes stronger as the pressure increases);
•
are used to model materials in which the compressive yield strength is greater than the tensile yield strength, such
as those commonly found in composite and polymeric materials;
•
allow a material to harden and/or soften isotropically;
•
generally allow for volume change with inelastic behavior: the ﬂow rule, deﬁning the inelastic straining, allows
simultaneous inelastic dilation (volume increase) and inelastic shearing;
•
can include creep in Abaqus/Standard if the material exhibits long-term inelastic deformations;
•
can be deﬁned to be sensitive to the rate of straining, as is often the case in polymeric materials;
•
can be used in conjunction with either the elastic material model (Linear Elastic Behavior) or, in Abaqus/Standard
if creep is not deﬁned, the porous elastic material model (Elastic Behavior of Porous Materials);
•
can be used in conjunction with an equation of state model (Equation of State) to describe the hydrodynamic
response of the material in Abaqus/Explicit;
•
can be used in conjunction with the models of progressive damage and failure (About Damage and Failure for
Ductile Metals) to specify different damage initiation criteria and damage evolution laws that allow for the progressive
degradation of the material stiffness and the removal of elements from the mesh; and
•
are intended to simulate material response under essentially monotonic loading.
Yield Criteria
The yield criteria for this class of models are based on the shape of the yield surface in the meridional plane.
The yield surface can have a linear form, a hyperbolic form, or a general exponent form. These surfaces are

Figure 1:Yield surfaces in the meridional plane.
The linear model (Figure 1a) provides for a possibly noncircular yield surface in the deviatoric plane ( -plane)
to match different yield values in triaxial tension and compression, associated inelastic ﬂow in the deviatoric
plane, and separate dilation and friction angles. Input data parameters deﬁne the shape of the yield and ﬂow
surfaces in the meridional and deviatoric planes as well as other characteristics of inelastic behavior such that a
range of simple theories is provided—the original Drucker-Prager model is available within this model. However,
this model cannot provide a close match to Mohr-Coulomb behavior, as described later in this section.
The hyperbolic and general exponent models use a von Mises (circular) section in the deviatoric stress plane. In
the meridional plane a hyperbolic ﬂow potential is used for both models, which, in general, means nonassociated
ﬂow.

Abaqus Materials Guide
Extended Drucker-Prager Models

The choice of model to be used depends largely on the analysis type, the kind of material, the experimental data
available for calibration of the model parameters, and the range of pressure stress values that the material is
likely to experience. It is common to have either triaxial test data at different levels of conﬁning pressure or test
data that are already calibrated in terms of a cohesion and a friction angle and, sometimes, a triaxial tensile
strength value. If triaxial test data are available, the material parameters must be calibrated ﬁrst. The accuracy
with which the linear model can match these test data is limited by the fact that it assumes linear dependence of
deviatoric stress on pressure stress. Although the hyperbolic model makes a similar assumption at high conﬁning
pressures, it provides a nonlinear relationship between deviatoric and pressure stress at low conﬁning pressures,
which may provide a better match of the triaxial experimental data. The hyperbolic model is useful for brittle
materials for which both triaxial compression and triaxial tension data are available, which is a common situation
for materials such as rocks. The most general of the three yield criteria is the exponent form. This criterion
provides the most ﬂexibility in matching triaxial test data. Abaqus determines the material parameters required
for this model directly from the triaxial test data. A least-squares ﬁt that minimizes the relative error in stress is
used for this purpose.
For cases where the experimental data are already calibrated in terms of a cohesion and a friction angle, the
linear model can be used. If these parameters are provided for a Mohr-Coulomb model, it is necessary to convert
them to Drucker-Prager parameters. The linear model is intended primarily for applications where the stresses
are mostly compressive. If tensile stresses are signiﬁcant, hydrostatic tension data should be available (along
with the cohesion and friction angle) and the hyperbolic model should be used.
Calibration of these models is discussed later in this section.
Hardening and Rate Dependence
For granular materials these models are often used as a failure surface, in the sense that the material can exhibit
unlimited ﬂow when the stress reaches yield. This behavior is called perfect plasticity. The models are also
provided with isotropic hardening. In this case plastic ﬂow causes the yield surface to change size uniformly
with respect to all stress directions. This hardening model is useful for cases involving gross plastic straining or
in which the straining at each point is essentially in the same direction in strain space throughout the analysis.
Although the model is referred to as an isotropic “hardening” model, strain softening, or hardening followed by
softening, can be deﬁned.
As strain rates increase, many materials show an increase in their yield strength. This effect becomes important
in many polymers when the strain rates range between 0.1 and 1 per second; it can be very important for strain
rates ranging between 10 and 100 per second, which are characteristic of high-energy dynamic events or
manufacturing processes. The effect is generally not as important in granular materials. The evolution of the
yield surface with plastic deformation is described in terms of the equivalent stress , which can be chosen as
either the uniaxial compression yield stress, the uniaxial tension yield stress, or the shear (cohesion) yield stress:

The functional dependence 
 includes hardening as well as rate-dependent effects. The material
data can be input either directly in a tabular format or by correlating it to static relations based on yield stress
ratios.
Rate dependence as described here is most suitable for moderate- to high-speed events in Abaqus/Standard.
Time-dependent inelastic deformation at low deformation rates can be better represented by creep models. Such
inelastic deformation, which can coexist with rate-independent plastic deformation, is described later in this
section. However, the existence of creep in an Abaqus/Standard material deﬁnition precludes the use of rate
dependence as described here.
When using the Drucker-Prager material model, Abaqus allows you to prescribe initial hardening by deﬁning
initial equivalent plastic strain values, as discussed below along with other details regarding the use of initial
conditions.
Direct Tabular Data
Test data are entered as tables of yield stress values versus equivalent plastic strain at different equivalent plastic
strain rates; one table per strain rate. Compression data are more commonly available for geological materials,
whereas tension data are usually available for polymeric materials. The guidelines on how to enter these data
are provided in Rate-Dependent Yield.

Extended Drucker-Prager Models

Linear Drucker-Prager Model
The linear model is written in terms of all three stress invariants. It provides for a possibly noncircular yield
surface in the deviatoric plane to match different yield values in triaxial tension and compression, associated
inelastic ﬂow in the deviatoric plane, and separate dilation and friction angles.
Yield Criterion
The linear Drucker-Prager criterion (see Figure 1a) is written as
where
is the slope of the linear yield surface in the p–t stress plane and is commonly referred to as the friction
angle of the material;
d
is the cohesion of the material; and
is the ratio of the yield stress in triaxial tension to the yield stress in triaxial compression and, thus, controls
the dependence of the yield surface on the value of the intermediate principal stress (see Figure 2).

Hyperbolic and General Exponent Models
The hyperbolic and general exponent models available are written in terms of the ﬁrst two stress invariants only.

The hyperbolic yield criterion is a continuous combination of the maximum tensile stress condition of Rankine

pressures because of the very tight curvature of the ﬂow potential locally where it intersects the p-axis.

Progressive Damage and Failure
In Abaqus/Explicit the extended Drucker-Prager models can be used in conjunction with the models of progressive
damage and failure discussed in About Damage and Failure for Ductile Metals. The capability allows for the
speciﬁcation of one or more damage initiation criteria, including ductile, shear, forming limit diagram (FLD),
forming limit stress diagram (FLSD), and Müschenborn-Sonne forming limit diagram (MSFLD) criteria. After
damage initiation, the material stiffness is degraded progressively according to the speciﬁed damage evolution
response. The model offers two failure choices, including the removal of elements from the mesh as a result of
tearing or ripping of the structure. The progressive damage models allow for a smooth degradation of the material
stiffness, making them suitable for both quasi-static and dynamic situations.

Matching Experimental Triaxial Test Data
Data for geological materials are most commonly available from triaxial testing. In such a test the specimen is
conﬁned by a pressure stress that is held constant during the test. The loading is an additional tension or
compression stress applied in one direction. Typical results include stress-strain curves at different levels of
conﬁnement, as shown in Figure 7.

levels of confinement.
To calibrate the yield parameters for this class of models, you need to decide which point on each stress-strain
curve will be used for calibration. For example, to calibrate the initial yield surface, the point in each stress-strain
curve corresponding to initial deviation from elastic behavior should be used. Alternatively, to calibrate the
ultimate yield surface, the point in each stress-strain curve corresponding to the peak stress should be used.
One stress data point from each stress-strain curve at a different level of conﬁnement is plotted in the meridional
stress plane (p–t plane if the linear model is to be used, or p–q plane if the hyperbolic or general exponent model
will be used). This technique calibrates the shape and position of the yield surface, as shown in Figure 8, and is
adequate to deﬁne a model if it is to be used as a failure surface (perfect plasticity).

The models are also available with isotropic hardening, in which case hardening data are required to complete
the calibration. In an isotropic hardening model plastic ﬂow causes the yield surface to change size uniformly;

curve that represents hardening most accurately over the range of loading conditions anticipated should be
selected (usually the curve for the average anticipated value of pressure stress).
As stated earlier, two types of triaxial test data are commonly available for geological materials. In a triaxial
compression test the specimen is conﬁned by pressure and an additional compression stress is superposed in one
direction. Thus, the principal stresses are all negative, with

Thus, K can be found by plotting these test results as q versus p and again ﬁtting the best straight line. The triaxial
compression and tension lines must intercept the p-axis at the same point, and the ratio of values of q for triaxial
tension and compression at the same value of p then gives K (Figure 10).

Drucker-Prager model. In addition, hydrostatic tension data are required to complete the calibration of the
hyperbolic model so that the initial hydrostatic tension strength, 
, can be deﬁned.
General Exponent Model
Given triaxial data in the meridional plane, Abaqus provides a capability to determine the material parameters
a, b, and 
 required for the exponent model. The parameters are determined on the basis of a “best ﬁt” of the
triaxial test data at different levels of conﬁning stress. A least-squares ﬁt which minimizes the relative error in
stress is used to obtain the “best ﬁt” values for a, b, and 
. The capability allows all three parameters to be
calibrated or, if some of the parameters are known, only the remaining parameters to be calibrated. This ability
is useful if only a few data points are available, in which case you may wish to ﬁt the best straight line (
)
through the data points (effectively reducing the model to a linear Drucker-Prager model). Partial calibration
can also be useful in a case when triaxial test data at low conﬁnement are unreliable or unavailable, as is often
the case for cohesionless materials. In this case a better ﬁt may be obtained if the value of 
 is speciﬁed and
only a and b are calibrated.
The data must be provided in terms of the principal stresses 
 and 
, where 
 is the conﬁning stress
and 
 is the stress in the loading direction. The Abaqus sign convention must be followed such that tensile
stresses are positive and compressive stresses are negative. One pair of stresses must be entered from each triaxial
test. As many data points as desired can be entered from triaxial tests at different levels of conﬁning stress.

Extended Drucker-Prager Models

If the exponent model is used as a failure surface (perfect plasticity), the Drucker-Prager hardening behavior
does not have to be speciﬁed. The hydrostatic tension strength, 
, obtained from the calibration will then be
used as the failure stress. However, if the Drucker-Prager hardening behavior is speciﬁed together with the
triaxial test data, the value of 
 obtained from the calibration will be ignored. In this case Abaqus will interpolate

Matching Mohr-Coulomb Parameters to the Drucker-Prager Model
Sometimes experimental data are not directly available. Instead, you are provided with the friction angle and
cohesion values for the Mohr-Coulomb model. In that case the simplest way to proceed is to use the
Mohr-Coulomb model (see Mohr-Coulomb Plasticity). In some situations it may be necessary to use the
Drucker-Prager model instead of the Mohr-Coulomb model (such as when rate effects need to be considered),
in which case we need to calculate values for the parameters of a Drucker-Prager model to provide a reasonable
match to the Mohr-Coulomb parameters.
The Mohr-Coulomb failure model is based on plotting Mohr's circle for states of stress at failure in the plane of
the maximum and minimum principal stresses. The failure line is the best straight line that touches these Mohr's
circles (Figure 11).

Substituting for  and , multiplying both sides by

where
is half of the difference between the maximum principal stress, 
, and the minimum principal stress, 
 (and
is, therefore, the maximum shear stress),
is the average of the maximum and minimum principal stresses, and  is the friction angle. Thus, the model
assumes a linear relationship between deviatoric and pressure stress and, so, can be matched by the linear or
hyperbolic Drucker-Prager models provided in Abaqus.
The Mohr-Coulomb model assumes that failure is independent of the value of the intermediate principal stress,
but the Drucker-Prager model does not. The failure of typical geotechnical materials generally includes some
small dependence on the intermediate principal stress, but the Mohr-Coulomb model is generally considered to
be sufﬁciently accurate for most applications. This model has vertices in the deviatoric plane (see Figure 12).

The implication is that, whenever the stress state has two equal principal stress values, the ﬂow direction can
change signiﬁcantly with little or no change in stress. None of the models currently available in Abaqus can
provide such behavior; even in the Mohr-Coulomb model the ﬂow potential is smooth. This limitation is generally
not a key concern in many design calculations involving Coulomb-like materials, but it can limit the accuracy
of the calculations, especially in cases where ﬂow localization is important.
Matching Plane Strain Response
Plane strain problems are often encountered in geotechnical analysis; for example, long tunnels, footings, and
embankments. Therefore, the constitutive model parameters are often matched to provide the same ﬂow and
failure response in plane strain.

Extended Drucker-Prager Models

The matching procedure described below is carried out in terms of the linear Drucker-Prager model but is also
applicable to the hyperbolic model at high levels of conﬁning stress.
The linear Drucker-Prager ﬂow potential deﬁnes the plastic strain increment as

Matching Triaxial Test Response
Another approach to matching Mohr-Coulomb and Drucker-Prager model parameters for materials with low
friction angles is to make the two models provide the same failure deﬁnition in triaxial compression and tension.
The following matching procedure is applicable only to the linear Drucker-Prager model since this is the only
model in this class that allows for different yield values in triaxial compression and tension.
We can rewrite the Mohr-Coulomb model in terms of principal stresses:
Using the results above for the stress invariants p, q, and r in triaxial compression and tension allows the linear
Drucker-Prager model to be written for triaxial compression as
and for triaxial tension as

Extended Drucker-Prager Models

We wish to make these expressions identical to the Mohr-Coulomb model for all values of 
. This is
possible by setting
By comparing the Mohr-Coulomb model with the linear Drucker-Prager model,
and, hence, from the previous result
These results for 
 and 
 provide linear Drucker-Prager parameters that match the Mohr-Coulomb model
in triaxial compression and tension.
The value of K in the linear Drucker-Prager model is restricted to 
 for the yield surface to remain
convex. The result for K shows that this implies 
. Many real materials have a larger Mohr-Coulomb
friction angle than this value. One approach in such circumstances is to choose 
 and then to use the
remaining equations to deﬁne  and 
. This approach matches the models for triaxial compression only, while
providing the closest approximation that the model can provide to failure being independent of the intermediate
principal stress. If  is signiﬁcantly larger than 22°, this approach may provide a poor Drucker-Prager match of
the Mohr-Coulomb parameters. Therefore, this matching procedure is not generally recommended; use the
Mohr-Coulomb model instead.
While using one-element tests to verify the calibration of the model, it should be noted that the Abaqus output
variables SP1, SP2, and SP3 correspond to the principal stresses 
, 
, and 
, respectively.
Creep Models for the Linear Drucker-Prager Model
Classical “creep” behavior of materials that exhibit plasticity according to the extended Drucker-Prager models
can be deﬁned in Abaqus/Standard. The creep behavior in such materials is intimately tied to the plasticity
behavior (through the deﬁnitions of creep ﬂow potentials and deﬁnitions of test data), so Drucker-Prager plasticity
and Drucker-Prager hardening must be included in the material deﬁnition.
Creep and plasticity can be active simultaneously, in which case the resulting equations are solved in a coupled
manner. To model creep only (without rate-independent plastic deformation), large values for the yield stress
should be provided in the Drucker-Prager hardening deﬁnition: the result is that the material follows the
Drucker-Prager model while it creeps, without ever yielding. When using this technique, a value must also be
deﬁned for the eccentricity, since, as described below, both the initial yield stress and eccentricity affect the
creep potentials. This capability is limited to the linear model with a von Mises (circular) section in the deviatoric
stress plane (
; i.e., no third stress invariant effects are taken into account) and can be combined only with
linear elasticity.
Creep behavior deﬁned by the extended Drucker-Prager model is active only during soils consolidation, coupled
temperature-displacement, and transient quasi-static procedures.
Creep Formulation
The creep potential is hyperbolic, similar to the plastic ﬂow potentials used in the hyperbolic and general exponent
plasticity models. If creep properties are deﬁned in Abaqus/Standard, the linear Drucker-Prager plasticity model
333
Abaqus Materials Guide
Extended Drucker-Prager Models

also uses a hyperbolic plastic ﬂow potential. As a consequence, if two analyses are run, one in which creep is
not activated and another in which creep properties are speciﬁed but produce virtually no creep ﬂow, the plasticity
solutions will not be exactly the same: the solution with creep not activated uses a linear plastic potential, whereas
the solution with creep activated uses a hyperbolic plastic potential.
Equivalent Creep Surface and Equivalent Creep Stress
We adopt the notion of the existence of creep isosurfaces of stress points that share the same creep “intensity,”
as measured by an equivalent creep stress. When the material plastiﬁes, it is desirable to have the equivalent
creep surface coincide with the yield surface; therefore, we deﬁne the equivalent creep surfaces by homogeneously
scaling down the yield surface. In the p–q plane that translates into parallels to the yield surface, as depicted in
Figure 13.

Figure 13: Equivalent creep stress defined as the shear stress.
Abaqus/Standard requires that creep properties be described in terms of the same type of data used to deﬁne
work hardening properties. The equivalent creep stress, 
, is then determined as follows:
Figure 13 shows how the equivalent point is determined when the material properties are in shear, with stress
d. A consequence of these concepts is that there is a cone in p–q space inside which creep is not active since any
point inside this cone would have a negative equivalent creep stress.
Creep Flow
The creep strain rate in Abaqus/Standard is assumed to follow from the same hyperbolic potential as the plastic
strain rate (see Figure 6):
where
Abaqus Materials Guide
334
Extended Drucker-Prager Models

is the dilation angle measured in the p–q plane at high conﬁning pressure;
is the initial yield stress taken from the user-speciﬁed Drucker-Prager hardening data; and
is a parameter, referred to as the eccentricity, that deﬁnes the rate at which the function approaches the
asymptote (the creep potential tends to a straight line as the eccentricity tends to zero).
Suitable default values are provided for , as described below. This creep potential, which is continuous and
smooth, ensures that the creep ﬂow direction is always uniquely deﬁned. The function approaches the linear
Drucker-Prager ﬂow potential asymptotically at high conﬁning pressure stress and intersects the hydrostatic
pressure axis at 90°. A family of hyperbolic potentials in the meridional stress plane was shown in Figure 6.
The creep potential is the von Mises circle in the deviatoric stress plane (the -plane).
The default creep potential eccentricity is 
, which implies that the material has almost the same dilation
angle over a wide range of conﬁning pressure stress values. Increasing the value of  provides more curvature
to the creep potential, implying that the dilation angle increases as the conﬁning pressure decreases. Values of
 that are signiﬁcantly less than the default value may lead to convergence problems if the material is subjected
to low conﬁning pressures, because of the very tight curvature of the creep potential locally where it intersects
the p-axis. For details on the behavior of these models refer to Veriﬁcation of creep integration.
If the creep material properties are deﬁned by a compression test, numerical problems may arise for very low
stress values. Abaqus/Standard protects for such a case, as described in Models for granular or polymer behavior.
Nonassociated Flow
The use of a creep potential different from the equivalent creep surface implies that the material stiffness matrix
is not symmetric; therefore, the unsymmetric matrix storage and solution scheme should be used (see Deﬁning
an Analysis). If the difference between  and  is not large and the region of the model in which inelastic
deformation is occurring is conﬁned, it is possible that a symmetric approximation to the material stiffness matrix
will give an acceptable rate of convergence and the unsymmetric matrix scheme may not be needed.
Specifying a Creep Law
The deﬁnition of creep behavior in Abaqus/Standard is completed by specifying the equivalent “uniaxial
behavior”—the creep “law.” In many practical cases the creep “law” is deﬁned through user subroutine CREEP
because creep laws are usually of very complex form to ﬁt experimental data. Data input methods are provided
for some simple cases. To avoid drawbacks of the time hardening and strain hardening forms, it is recommended
that you use the time power law model rather than the time hardening form and the power law model rather than
the strain hardening form, as discussed below.
User Subroutine CREEP
User subroutine CREEP provides a very general capability for implementing viscoplastic models in
Abaqus/Standard in which the strain rate potential can be written as a function of the equivalent stress and any
number of “solution-dependent state variables.” When used in conjunction with these material models, the
equivalent creep stress, 
, is made available in the routine. Solution-dependent state variables are any variables
that are used in conjunction with the constitutive deﬁnition and whose values evolve with the solution. Examples

In the “time hardening” form and the time power law model, the total time or the creep time can be used. The

procedures with time-dependent material behavior. If the total time is used, it is recommended that small step
times compared to the creep time be used for any steps for which creep is not active in an analysis; this is
necessary to avoid changes in hardening behavior in subsequent steps.

Numerical Difficulties
Depending on the choice of units for the creep laws described above, the value of A may be very small for typical
creep strain rates. If A is less than 
, numerical difﬁculties can cause errors in the material calculations.
Therefore, use another system of units or use the time power law or power law model to avoid such difﬁculties
in the calculation of creep strain increments.
Creep Integration
Abaqus/Standard provides both explicit and implicit time integration of creep and swelling behavior. The choice
of the time integration scheme depends on the procedure type, the parameters speciﬁed for the procedure, the
presence of plasticity, and whether or not a geometric linear or nonlinear analysis is requested, as discussed in
Rate-Dependent Plasticity: Creep and Swelling.
Initial Conditions
When we need to study the behavior of a material that has already been subjected to some work hardening,
Abaqus allows you to prescribe initial conditions for the equivalent plastic strain, 
, by specifying the conditions
directly (see Initial Conditions). For more complicated cases initial conditions can be deﬁned in Abaqus/Standard
through user subroutine HARDINI.

Overview
The modiﬁed Drucker-Prager/Cap plasticity/creep model:
•
is intended to model cohesive geological materials that exhibit pressure-dependent yield, such as soils and rocks;
•
is based on the addition of a cap yield surface to the Drucker-Prager plasticity model (Extended Drucker-Prager
Models), which provides an inelastic hardening mechanism to account for plastic compaction and helps to control
volume dilatancy when the material yields in shear;
•
can be used in Abaqus/Standard to simulate creep in materials exhibiting long-term inelastic deformation through
a cohesion creep mechanism in the shear failure region and a consolidation creep mechanism in the cap region;
•
can be used in conjunction with either the elastic material model (Linear Elastic Behavior) or, in Abaqus/Standard if
creep is not deﬁned, the porous elastic material model (Elastic Behavior of Porous Materials); and
•
provides a reasonable response to large stress reversals in the cap region; however, in the failure surface region the
response is reasonable only for essentially monotonic loading.
Yield Surface
The addition of the cap yield surface to the Drucker-Prager model serves two main purposes: it bounds the yield
surface in hydrostatic compression, thus providing an inelastic hardening mechanism to represent plastic
compaction; and it helps to control volume dilatancy when the material yields in shear by providing softening
as a function of the inelastic volume increase created as the material yields on the Drucker-Prager shear failure
surface.
The yield surface has two principal segments: a pressure-dependent Drucker-Prager shear failure segment and
a compression cap segment, as shown in Figure 1. The Drucker-Prager failure segment is a perfectly plastic
yield surface (no hardening). Plastic ﬂow on this segment produces inelastic volume increase (dilation) that
causes the cap to soften. On the cap surface plastic ﬂow causes the material to compact. The model is described
in detail in Drucker-Prager/Cap model for geological materials.

 implies that the yield surface is the von Mises circle in the deviatoric principal stress plane
(the -plane), so that the yield stresses in triaxial tension and compression are the same; this is the default
behavior in Abaqus/Standard and the only behavior available in Abaqus/Explicit. To ensure that the yield surface
remains convex requires

Cap Yield Surface
The cap yield surface has an elliptical shape with constant eccentricity in the meridional (p–t) plane (Figure 1)
and also includes dependence on the third stress invariant in the deviatoric plane (Figure 2). The cap surface
hardens or softens as a function of the volumetric inelastic strain: volumetric plastic and/or creep compaction
(when yielding on the cap and/or creeping according to the consolidation mechanism, as described later in this
section) causes hardening, while volumetric plastic and/or creep dilation (when yielding on the shear failure
surface and/or creeping according to the cohesion mechanism, as described later in this section) causes softening.
The cap yield surface is

hydrostatic compression yield stress, 
, and volumetric inelastic strain (Figure 3):

pressure yield stress is deﬁned as a tabular function of the volumetric inelastic strain, and, if desired, a function
of temperature and other predeﬁned ﬁeld variables. The range of values for which 
 is deﬁned should be
sufﬁcient to include all values of effective pressure stress that the material is subjected to during the analysis. If
the absolute value of the volumetric inelastic strain becomes greater than the last user-speciﬁed value,
Abaqus/Explicit extrapolates the stress-strain relationship based on the slope at the last point of the curve.

Plastic Flow
Plastic ﬂow is deﬁned by a ﬂow potential that is associated in the deviatoric plane, associated in the cap region
in the meridional plane, and nonassociated in the failure surface and transition regions in the meridional plane.
The ﬂow potential surface that we use in the meridional plane is shown in Figure 4: it is made up of an elliptical
portion in the cap region that is identical to the cap yield surface,
and another elliptical portion in the failure and transition regions that provides the nonassociated ﬂow component
in the model,
The two elliptical portions form a continuous and smooth potential surface.

Nonassociated Flow
Nonassociated ﬂow implies that the material stiffness matrix is not symmetric and the unsymmetric matrix
storage and solution scheme should be used in Abaqus/Standard (see Deﬁning an Analysis). If the region of the
model in which nonassociated inelastic deformation is occurring is conﬁned, it is possible that a symmetric
approximation to the material stiffness matrix gives an acceptable rate of convergence; in such cases the
unsymmetric matrix scheme may not be needed.
Relative Density
The relative density of the material, 
, is deﬁned as the ratio of the volume of solid material to the total volume
of the material. The void volume fraction or porosity, , is deﬁned as the ratio of the volume of voids to the total

Conditions). This indirectly initializes 
 at material points through the relation

Calibration
At least three experiments are required to calibrate the simplest version of the Cap model: a hydrostatic
compression test (an odometer test is also acceptable) and either two triaxial compression tests or one triaxial
compression test and one uniaxial compression test (more than two tests are recommended for a more accurate
calibration).
The hydrostatic compression test is performed by pressurizing the sample equally in all directions. The applied
pressure and the volume change are recorded.
The uniaxial compression test involves compressing the sample between two rigid platens. The load and
displacement in the direction of loading are recorded. The lateral displacements should also be recorded so that
the correct volume changes can be calibrated.
Triaxial compression experiments are performed using a standard triaxial machine where a ﬁxed conﬁning
pressure is maintained while the differential stress is applied. Several tests covering the range of conﬁning
pressures of interest are usually performed. Again, the stress and strain in the direction of loading are recorded,
together with the lateral strain so that the correct volume changes can be calibrated.
Unloading measurements in these tests are useful to calibrate the elasticity, particularly in cases where the initial
elastic region is not well deﬁned.
345
Abaqus Materials Guide
Modified Drucker-Prager/Cap Model

The hydrostatic compression test stress-strain curve gives the evolution of the hydrostatic compression yield
stress, 
, required for the cap hardening curve deﬁnition.
The friction angle, , and cohesion, d, which deﬁne the shear failure dependence on hydrostatic pressure, are
calculated by plotting the failure stresses of the two triaxial compression tests (or the triaxial compression test
and the uniaxial compression test) in the pressure stress (p) versus shear stress (q) space: the slope of the straight
line passing through the two points gives the angle  and the intersection with the q-axis gives d. For more details
on the calibration of  and d, see the discussion on calibration in Extended Drucker-Prager Models.
R represents the curvature of the cap part of the yield surface and can be calibrated from a number of triaxial
tests at high conﬁning pressures (in the cap region). R must be between 0.0001 and 1000.0.
Abaqus/Standard Creep Model
Classical “creep” behavior of materials that exhibit plasticity according to the capped Drucker-Prager plasticity
model can be deﬁned in Abaqus/Standard. The creep behavior in such materials is intimately tied to the plasticity
behavior (through the deﬁnitions of creep ﬂow potentials and deﬁnitions of test data), so cap plasticity and cap
hardening must be included in the material deﬁnition. If no rate-independent plastic behavior is desired in the
model, large values for the cohesion, d, as well as large values for the compression yield stress, 
, should be
provided in the plasticity deﬁnition: as a result the material follows the capped Drucker-Prager model while it
creeps, without ever yielding. This capability is limited to cases in which there is no third stress invariant
dependence of the yield surface (
) and cases in which the yield surface has no transition region (
).
The elastic behavior must be deﬁned using linear isotropic elasticity (see Deﬁning Isotropic Elasticity).
Creep behavior deﬁned for the modiﬁed Drucker-Prager/Cap model is active only during soils consolidation,
coupled temperature-displacement, and transient quasi-static procedures.
Creep Formulation
This model has two possible creep mechanisms that are active in different loading regions: one is a cohesion
mechanism, which follows the type of plasticity active in the shear-failure plasticity region, and the other is a
consolidation mechanism, which follows the type of plasticity active in the cap plasticity region. Figure 5 shows
the regions of applicability of the creep mechanisms in p–q space.

Equivalent Creep Surface and Equivalent Creep Stress for the Cohesion Creep Mechanism
Consider the cohesion creep mechanism ﬁrst. We adopt the notion of the existence of creep isosurfaces of stress
points that share the same creep “intensity,” as measured by an equivalent creep stress. Since it is desirable to
have the equivalent creep surface coincide with the yield surface, we deﬁne the equivalent creep surfaces by
homogeneously scaling down the yield surface. In the p–q plane the equivalent creep surfaces translate into
surfaces that are parallel to the yield surface, as depicted in Figure 6.

Figure 6: Equivalent creep stress for cohesion creep.
Abaqus/Standard requires that cohesion creep properties be measured in a uniaxial compression test. The
equivalent creep stress, 
, is determined as follows:
Abaqus/Standard also requires that 
 be positive. Figure 6 shows such an equivalent creep stress. A consequence
of these concepts is that there is a cone in p–q space inside which creep is not active. Any point inside this cone
would have a negative equivalent creep stress.
Equivalent Creep Surface and Equivalent Creep Stress for the Consolidation Creep Mechanism
Next, consider the consolidation creep mechanism. In this case we wish to make creep dependent on the hydrostatic
pressure above a threshold value of 
, with a smooth transition to the areas in which the mechanism is not active
(
). Therefore, we deﬁne equivalent creep surfaces as constant hydrostatic pressure surfaces (vertical lines
in the p–q plane). Abaqus/Standard requires that consolidation creep properties be measured in a hydrostatic
compression test. The effective creep pressure, 
, is then the point on the p-axis with a relative pressure of
. This value is used in the uniaxial creep law. The equivalent volumetric creep strain rate produced
by this type of law is deﬁned as positive for a positive equivalent pressure. The internal tensor calculations in
Abaqus/Standard account for the fact that a positive pressure will produce negative (that is, compressive)
volumetric creep components.
Creep Flow
The creep strain rate produced by the cohesion mechanism is assumed to follow a potential that is similar to that
of the creep strain rate in the Drucker-Prager creep model (Extended Drucker-Prager Models); that is, a hyperbolic
function:
347
Abaqus Materials Guide
Modified Drucker-Prager/Cap Model

This creep ﬂow potential, which is continuous and smooth, ensures that the ﬂow direction is always uniquely
deﬁned. The function approaches a parallel to the shear-failure yield surface asymptotically at high conﬁning
pressure stress and intersects the hydrostatic pressure axis at a right angle. A family of hyperbolic potentials in
the meridional stress plane is shown in Figure 7. The cohesion creep potential is the von Mises circle in the
deviatoric stress plane (the -plane).

volumetric components of creep strain from both mechanisms contribute to the hardening/softening of the cap,
as described previously. For details on the behavior of these models refer to Veriﬁcation of creep integration.
Nonassociated Flow
The use of a creep potential for the cohesion mechanism different from the equivalent creep surface implies that
the material stiffness matrix is not symmetric, and the unsymmetric matrix storage and solution scheme should
be used (see Deﬁning an Analysis). If the region of the model in which cohesive inelastic deformation is occurring

348

is conﬁned, it is possible that a symmetric approximation to the material stiffness matrix will give an acceptable
rate of convergence; in such cases the unsymmetric matrix scheme may not be needed.
Specifying Creep Laws
The deﬁnition of the creep behavior is completed by specifying the equivalent “uniaxial behavior”—the creep
“laws.” In many practical cases the creep laws are deﬁned through user subroutine CREEP because creep laws
are usually of complex form to ﬁt experimental data. Data input methods are provided for some simple cases.
To avoid drawbacks of the time hardening and strain hardening forms, it is recommended that you use the time
power law model rather than the time hardening form and the power law model rather than the strain hardening
form, as discussed below.
User Subroutine CREEP
User subroutine CREEP provides a general capability for implementing viscoplastic models in which the strain
rate potential can be written as a function of the equivalent stress and any number of “solution-dependent state
variables.” When used in conjunction with these materials, the equivalent cohesion creep stress, 
, and the
effective creep pressure, 
, are made available in the routine. Solution-dependent state variables are any
variables that are used in conjunction with the constitutive deﬁnition and whose values evolve with the solution.
Examples are hardening variables associated with the model. When a more general form is required for the stress
potential, user subroutine UMAT can be used.

Time-Dependent Behavior
In the “time hardening” form, the time power law model, and the Singh-Mitchell law model, the total time or
the creep time can be used. The total time is the accumulated time over all general analysis steps. The creep time
is the sum of the times of the procedures with time-dependent material behavior. If the total time is used, it is
recommended that small step times compared to the creep time be used for any steps for which creep is not active
in an analysis; this is necessary to avoid changes in hardening behavior in subsequent steps.

Numerical Difficulties
Depending on the choice of units for the creep laws described above, the value of A may be very small for typical
creep strain rates. If A is less than 10−27, numerical difﬁculties can cause errors in the material calculations.
Therefore, use another system of units or use the time power law or power law model to avoid such difﬁculties
in the calculation of creep strain increments.
Creep Integration
Abaqus/Standard provides both explicit and implicit time integration of creep and swelling behavior. The choice
of the time integration scheme depends on the procedure type, the parameters speciﬁed for the procedure, the
presence of plasticity, and whether or not a geometric linear or nonlinear analysis is requested, as discussed in
Rate-Dependent Plasticity: Creep and Swelling.
Initial Conditions
The initial stress at a point can be deﬁned (see Deﬁning Initial Stresses). If such a stress point lies outside the
initially deﬁned cap or transition yield surfaces and under the projection of the shear failure surface in the p–t
plane (illustrated in Figure 1), Abaqus will try to adjust the initial position of the cap to make the stress point
lie on the yield surface and a warning message will be issued. If the stress point lies outside the Drucker-Prager
failure surface (or above its projection), an error message will be issued and execution will be terminated.

Overview
The soft rock plasticity model provided in Abaqus:
•
is intended to model the mechanical response of soft rock and weakly consolidated sands;
•
describes the inelastic behavior of the material by an isotropic yield function that depends on the three stress
invariants, a non-associated ﬂow assumption to deﬁne the plastic strain rate, and a strain hardening theory that
changes the size of the yield surface according to the inelastic volumetric strain;
•
is based on the constitutive model proposed by Crook et al. (2006);
•
requires that the elastic part of the deformation be deﬁned by using the isotropic linear elastic material model
(Linear Elastic Behavior) or, in Abaqus/Standard, the power-law based porous elastic material model (Elastic
Behavior of Porous Materials) within the same material deﬁnition;
•
captures the transition of the yield surface in the -plane from a rounded-triangular shape to a circular shape with
an increase in pressure;
•
allows for the hardening law to be deﬁned by a piecewise linear form;
•
may optionally include hardening in hydrostatic tension; and
•
can be used in conjunction with a regularization scheme for mitigating mesh dependence in situations where the
material exhibits strain localization with increasing plastic deformation.

Plastic ﬂow is based on a nonassociated rule with iso-surfaces of the ﬂow potential being used for the calculation

where  is the dilation angle and all other constants are same as in the expression for the yield surface.
Nonassociated Flow
Nonassociated ﬂow implies that the material stiffness matrix is not symmetric and the unsymmetric matrix
storage and solution scheme should be used in Abaqus/Standard (see Deﬁning an Analysis). If the region of the
model in which nonassociated inelastic deformation is occurring is conﬁned, it is possible that a symmetric
approximation to the material stiffness matrix will give an acceptable rate of convergence; in such cases the
unsymmetric matrix scheme may not be needed.
Eccentricity
The eccentricity parameter, 
, is used to ensure uniqueness of the plastic ﬂow at  = 
 and  = 
. The ﬂow
potential tends to a straight line as the eccentricity tends to zero (Figure 3). The default value is 0.001.

Softening Regularization
Granular materials often exhibit strain localization with increasing plastic deformation. Post-failure solutions
from conventional ﬁnite element methods can be strongly mesh dependent. To mitigate the mesh dependency
of the solutions, a regularization method is often used to introduce a micro-structural length scale into the
constitutive formulation. Let 
 denote the characteristic width of a shear band or a crack band, 
 denote the
characteristic length of the element, and 
 denote the inelastic strain for the element. Then the inelastic strain
in the localization band, 
, is deﬁned to be

where 
 is a material parameter and 
 is a positive number used for bounding the magnitude of regularization.
This strain regularization method is valid only when the characteristic length of the element is greater than the
width of the localization band; i.e., 
.
If softening regularization is included, it is applied to all hardening data (tension and compression) by default.
You can optionally turn off softening regularization for a speciﬁc type of hardening.

Initial Conditions
If an initial stress at a point is given (see Deﬁning Initial Stresses) such that the stress point lies outside the
initially deﬁned yield surface, Abaqus will try to adjust the initial position of the surface to make the stress point
lie on it and issue a warning. However, if the yield stress in hydrostatic tension, 
, is zero and does not evolve
with volumetric plastic strain and the stress point is such that the equivalent pressure stress, p, is negative, Abaqus
issues an error message and execution is terminated.
The initial condition on volumetric plastic strain, 
, can be deﬁned in the deﬁnition of the soft rock plasticity
model. Abaqus also allows a general method of specifying the initial plastic strain ﬁeld on elements (see Deﬁning
Initial Values of Plastic Strain). The volumetric plastic strain is then calculated as

Overview
The Mohr-Coulomb plasticity model:
•
is used to model materials with the classical Mohr-Coloumb yield criterion;
•
allows the material to harden and/or soften isotropically;
•
uses a smooth ﬂow potential that has a hyperbolic shape in the meridional stress plane and a piecewise elliptic
shape in the deviatoric stress plane;
•
is used with the linear elastic material model (Linear Elastic Behavior);
•
can be used with the Rankine surface (tension cutoff) to limit load carrying capacity near the tensile region; and
•
can be used for design applications in the geotechnical engineering area to simulate material response under
essentially monotonic loading.
Elastic Behavior
The elastic part of the response is speciﬁed as described in Linear Elastic Behavior. Linear isotropic elasticity
is assumed.
Plastic Behavior:Yield Criteria
The yield surface is a composite of two different criteria: a shear criterion, known as the Mohr-Coulomb surface,
and an optional tension cutoff criterion, modeled using the Rankine surface.
Mohr-Coulomb Surface
The Mohr-Coulomb criterion assumes that yield occurs when the shear stress on any point in a material reaches
a value that depends linearly on the normal stress in the same plane. The Mohr-Coulomb model is based on
plotting Mohr's circle for states of stress at yield in the plane of the maximum and minimum principal stresses.
The yield line is the best straight line that touches these Mohr's circles (Figure 1).

directly. Convexity and smoothness of the elliptic function requires that

This ﬂow potential, which is continuous and smooth, ensures that the ﬂow direction is always uniquely deﬁned.

Nonassociated Flow

unsymmetric matrix storage and solution scheme in Abaqus/Standard (see Deﬁning an Analysis).

associated ﬂow assumption to deﬁne the plastic strain rate, and a strain hardening theory that changes the size of
the yield surface according to the inelastic volumetric strain;

•
requires that the elastic part of the deformation be deﬁned by using the isotropic or orthotropic linear elastic material
model (Linear Elastic Behavior) or, in Abaqus/Standard, the porous elastic material model (Elastic Behavior of
Porous Materials) within the same material deﬁnition (porous elasticity is supported only for isotropic yield
functions);

allows for the hardening law to be deﬁned by a piecewise linear form or, in Abaqus/Standard, by an exponential
form;

Softening Regularization
Granular materials often exhibit strain localization with increasing plastic deformation. Post-failure solutions
from conventional ﬁnite element methods can be strongly mesh dependent. To mitigate the mesh dependency
of the solutions, a regularization method is often used to introduce a micro-structural length scale into the
constitutive formulation. Let 
 denote the characteristic width of a shear band or a crack band, 
 the
characteristic length of the element, and 
 the inelastic strain for the element. Then the inelastic strain in the
localization band, 
, is deﬁned to be
where 
 is a material parameter and 
 is a positive number used for bounding the magnitude of regularization.
This strain regularization method is valid only when the characteristic length of the element is greater than the
width of the localization band; that is, 
.
If softening regularization is included, it is applied to all hardening data (tension and compression) by default.
You can optionally turn off softening regularization for a speciﬁc type of hardening.

Calibration
At least two experiments are required to calibrate the simplest version of the Cam-clay model: a hydrostatic
compression test (an oedometer test is also acceptable) and a triaxial compression test (more than one triaxial
test is useful for a more accurate calibration).
Hydrostatic Compression Tests
The hydrostatic compression test is performed by pressurizing the sample equally in all directions. The applied
pressure and the volume change are recorded.
The onset of yielding in the hydrostatic compression test immediately provides the initial position of the yield
surface, 
. The logarithmic bulk moduli,  and , are determined from the hydrostatic compression experimental
data by plotting the logarithm of pressure versus void ratio. The void ratio, e, is related to the measured volume
change as
The slope of the line obtained for the elastic regime is 
, and the slope in the inelastic range is 
. For a valid
model 
.
Triaxial Tests
Triaxial compression experiments are performed using a standard triaxial machine where a ﬁxed conﬁning
pressure is maintained while the differential stress is applied. Several tests covering the range of conﬁning
pressures of interest are usually performed. Again, the stress and strain in the direction of loading are recorded,
together with the lateral strain so that the correct volume changes can be calibrated.
The triaxial compression tests allow the calibration of the yield parameters M and . M is the ratio of the shear
stress, q, to the pressure stress, p, at critical state and can be obtained from the stress values when the material

 must be between 0.0 and 1.0.
To calibrate the parameter K, which controls the yield dependence on the third stress invariant, experimental
results obtained from a true triaxial (cubical) test are necessary. These results are generally not available, and
you might have to guess (the value of K is generally between 0.8 and 1.0) or ignore this effect.
To calculate the yield stress in hydrostatic tension, you can plot the data obtained from the triaxial compression
tests on the –  plane and extend the curve obtained from ﬁtting these experimental data to the pressure axis in
the tensile region.

Unloading Measurements
Unloading measurements in hydrostatic and triaxial compression tests are useful to calibrate the elasticity,
particularly in cases where the initial elastic region is not well deﬁned. From these we can identify whether a
constant shear modulus or a constant Poisson's ratio should be used and what their values are.
Initial Conditions
If an initial stress at a point is given (see Deﬁning Initial Stresses) such that the stress point lies outside the
initially deﬁned yield surface, Abaqus will try to adjust the initial position of the surface to make the stress point
lie on it and issue a warning. However, if the yield stress in hydrostatic tension, 
, is zero and does not evolve
with volumetric plastic strain and the stress point is such that the equivalent pressure stress, p, is negative, an
error message will be issued and execution will be terminated.
The initial condition on volumetric plastic strain, 
, can be deﬁned in the deﬁnition of the clay plasticity
model. Abaqus also allows a general method of specifying the initial plastic strain ﬁeld on elements (see Deﬁning
Initial Values of Plastic Strain). The volumetric plastic strain is then calculated as
Elements
The clay plasticity model can be used with plane strain, generalized plane strain, axisymmetric, and
three-dimensional solid (continuum) elements in Abaqus. This model cannot be used with elements for which
the assumed stress state is plane stress (plane stress, shell, and membrane elements).

Overview
The crushable foam plasticity models:
•
are intended for the analysis of crushable foams that are typically used as energy absorption structures;
•
can be used to model crushable materials other than foams (such as balsa wood);
•
are used to model the enhanced ability of a foam material to deform in compression due to cell wall buckling
processes (it is assumed that the resulting deformation is not recoverable instantaneously and can, thus, be idealized
as being plastic for short duration events);
•
can be used to model the difference between a foam material's compressive strength and its much smaller tensile
bearing capacity resulting from cell wall breakage in tension;
•
must be used in conjunction with the linear elastic material model (Linear Elastic Behavior);
•
can be used when rate-dependent effects are important; and
•
are intended to simulate material response under essentially monotonic loading.
Elastic and Plastic Behavior
The elastic part of the response is speciﬁed as described in Linear Elastic Behavior.
For the plastic part of the behavior, the yield surface is a Mises circle in the deviatoric stress plane and an ellipse
in the meridional (p–q) stress plane. Two hardening models are available: the volumetric hardening model, where
the point on the yield ellipse in the meridional plane that represents hydrostatic tension loading is ﬁxed and the
evolution of the yield surface is driven by the volumetric compacting plastic strain, and the isotropic hardening
model, where the yield ellipse is centered at the origin in the p–q stress plane and evolves in a geometrically
self-similar manner. This phenomenological isotropic model was originally developed for metallic foams by
Deshpande and Fleck (2000).
The hardening curve must describe the uniaxial compression yield stress as a function of the corresponding
plastic strain. In deﬁning this dependence at ﬁnite strains, “true” (Cauchy) stress and logarithmic strain values
should be given. Both models predict similar behavior for compression-dominated loading. However, for
hydrostatic tension loading the volumetric hardening model assumes a perfectly plastic behavior, while the
isotropic hardening model predicts the same behavior in both hydrostatic tension and hydrostatic compression.

Crushable Foam Model with Volumetric Hardening
The crushable foam model with volumetric hardening uses a yield surface with an elliptical dependence of
deviatoric stress on pressure stress. It assumes that the evolution of the yield surface is controlled by the volumetric
compacting plastic strain experienced by the material.

To use this model, one needs to know the initial yield stress in uniaxial compression, 
; the initial yield stress
in hydrostatic compression, 
; and the yield strength in hydrostatic tension, 
. Since foam materials are rarely
tested in tension, it is usually necessary to guess the magnitude of the strength of the foam in hydrostatic tension,

stressed in hydrostatic tension. A common approximation is to set 
 equal to 5% to 10% of the initial yield
stress in hydrostatic compression 
; thus, 
= 0.05 to 0.10.
Flow Potential
The plastic strain rate for the volumetric hardening model is assumed to be
where G is the ﬂow potential, chosen in this model as
and 
 is the equivalent plastic strain rate deﬁned as
The equivalent plastic strain rate is related to the rate of axial plastic strain, 
, in uniaxial compression by
A geometrical representation of the ﬂow potential in the p–q stress plane is shown in Figure 1. This potential
gives a direction of ﬂow that is identical to the stress direction for radial paths. This is motivated by simple
laboratory experiments that suggest that loading in any principal direction causes insigniﬁcant deformation in
the other directions. As a result, the plastic ﬂow is nonassociative for the volumetric hardening model. For more
details regarding plastic ﬂow, see About plasticity models.
Nonassociated Flow
The nonassociated plastic ﬂow rule makes the material stiffness matrix unsymmetric; therefore, the unsymmetric
matrix storage and solution scheme should be used in Abaqus/Standard (see Deﬁning an Analysis). Usage of
this scheme is especially important when large regions of the model are expected to ﬂow plastically.
Hardening
The yield surface intersects the p-axis at 
 and 
. We assume that 
 remains ﬁxed throughout any plastic
deformation process. By contrast, the compressive strength, 
, evolves as a result of compaction (increase in
density) or dilation (reduction in density) of the material. The evolution of the yield surface can be expressed
through the evolution of the yield surface size on the hydrostatic stress axis, 
, as a function of the value
of volumetric compacting plastic strain, 
. With 
 constant, this relation can be obtained from user-provided
uniaxial compression test data using
along with the fact that 
 in uniaxial compression for the volumetric hardening model. Thus, you
provide input to the hardening law by specifying, in the usual tabular form, only the value of the yield stress in
uniaxial compression as a function of the absolute value of the axial plastic strain. The table must start with a
zero plastic strain (corresponding to the virgin state of the material), and the tabular entries must be given in
ascending magnitude of

Rate Dependence
As strain rates increase, many materials show an increase in the yield stress. For many crushable foam materials
this increase in yield stress becomes important when the strain rates are in the range of 0.1–1 per second and
can be very important if the strain rates are in the range of 10–100 per second, as commonly occurs in high-energy
dynamic events.
Two methods for specifying strain-rate-dependent material behavior are available in Abaqus as discussed below.
Both methods assume that the shapes of the hardening curves at different strain rates are similar, and either can
be used in static or dynamic procedures. When rate dependence is included, the static stress-strain hardening
behavior must be speciﬁed for the crushable foam as described above.
Overstress Power Law
You can specify a Cowper-Symonds overstress power law that deﬁnes strain rate dependence. This law has the
form
with
where B is the size of the static yield surface and 
 is the size of the yield surface at a nonzero strain rate. The
ratio R can be written as
where r is the uniaxial compression yield stress ratio deﬁned by
, speciﬁed as part of the crushable foam hardening deﬁnition, is the uniaxial compression yield stress at a
given value of 
 for the experiment with the lowest strain rate and can depend on temperature and predeﬁned
ﬁeld variables; D and n are material parameters that can be functions of temperature and, possibly, of other
predeﬁned ﬁeld variables.
The power-law rate dependency can be rewritten in the following form
The procedure outlined below can be followed to obtain the material parameters D and n based on the uniaxial
compression test data.
1. Compute R using the uniaxial compression yield stress ratio, r.
2. Convert the rate of the axial plastic strain,

As strain rates increase, many materials show an increase in the yield stress. For many crushable foam materials
this increase in yield stress becomes important when the strain rates are in the range of 0.1–1 per second and

Two methods for specifying strain-rate-dependent material behavior are available in Abaqus as discussed below.
Both methods assume that the shapes of the hardening curves at different strain rates are similar, and either can

, where 
 is the uniaxial compression yield stress.
PEEQ
The volumetric plastic strain, 
, is the trace of the plastic strain tensor; you can also calculate it as the sum of
direct plastic strain components.
For the volumetric hardening model, the initial values of the volumetric compacting plastic strain can be speciﬁed
for elements that use the crushable foam material model, as described above. The volumetric compacting plastic
strain (output variable PEEQ) provided by Abaqus then contains the initial value of the volumetric compacting
plastic strain plus any additional volumetric compacting plastic strain due to plastic straining during the analysis.
However, the plastic strain tensor (output variable PE) contains only the amount of straining due to deformation
during the analysis.

Overview
The fabric material model:
•
is anisotropic and nonlinear;
•
is a phenomenological model that captures the mechanical response of a woven fabric made of yarns in the ﬁll and
the warp directions;
•
is valid for materials that exhibit two “structural” directions that may not be orthogonal to each other with
deformation;
•
deﬁnes the local fabric stresses as a function of change in angle between the ﬁbers (shear strain) and the nominal
strains along the yarn directions;
•
allows for the computation of local fabric stresses based on test data or through user subroutine VFABRIC, which
can be used to deﬁne a complex constitutive model; and
•
requires that geometric nonlinearity be accounted for during the analysis step (General and Perturbation Procedures),
since it is intended for ﬁnite-strain applications.
The fabric material model deﬁned based on test data:
•
assumes that the responses along the ﬁll and the warp directions are independent of each other and that the shear
response is independent of the direct response along the yarns;
•
can include separate loading and unloading responses;
•
can exhibit nonlinear elastic behavior, damaged elastic behavior, or elastic-plastic type behavior with permanent
deformation upon complete unloading;
•
can deform elastically to large tensile and shear strains; and
•
can have properties that depend on temperature and/or other ﬁeld variables.

Fabric Material Behavior
Woven fabrics are used in a number of engineering applications across various industries, including such products
as automobile airbags; ﬂexible structures like boat sails and parachutes; reinforcement in composites; architectural
expressions in building roof structures; protective vests for military, police, and other security circles; and
protective layers around the fuselage in planes.
Woven fabrics consist of yarns woven in the ﬁll and the warp directions. The yarn is crimped, or curved, as it
is woven up and down over the cross yarns. The nonlinear mechanical behavior of the fabric arises from different
sources: the nonlinear response of the individual yarns, the exchange of crimp between the ﬁll and the warp
yarns as they are stretched, and the contact and friction between the yarns in cross directions and between the
yarns in the same direction. In general, the fabric exhibits a signiﬁcant stiffness only along the yarn directions
under tension. The tensile response in the ﬁll and warp directions may be coupled due to the crimp exchange
mentioned above. Under in-plane shear deformation, the ﬁll and warp direction yarns rotate with respect to each
other. The resistance increases with shear deformation as lateral contact is formed between the yarns in each
direction. The fabrics typically have negligible stiffness in bending and in-plane compression.
The behavior of woven fabrics is modeled phenomenologically in Abaqus/Explicit to capture the nonlinear
anisotropic behavior of the fabric. The planar kinematic state of a given fabric is described in terms of the nominal
direct strains in the fabric plane along the ﬁll and the warp directions and the angle between the two yarn
directions. The material orthogonal basis and the yarn local directions are illustrated in Figure 1 showing the
reference and the deformed conﬁgurations.

The engineering nominal shear strain, 
, is deﬁned as the change in angle, 
 between the two yarn directions
going from the reference to the deformed conﬁguration. The nominal strains along the yarn directions 
 and
 in the deformed conﬁguration are computed from the respective yarn stretch values, 
 and

corresponding nominal stress components 
, and 
 are deﬁned as the work conjugate of the above
nominal strains. The fabric nominal stress, , is converted by Abaqus to the Cauchy stress, ; and the subsequent
internal forces arising from the fabric deformation are computed. You can obtain output of the fabric nominal
strains, the fabric nominal stresses, and the regular Cauchy stresses. The relationship between the Cauchy stress,
, and the nominal stress, , is

Either experimental data or a user subroutine, VFABRIC, can be used to characterize the Abaqus/Explicit fabric
material model, providing the nominal fabric stress as a function of the nominal fabric strains. The user subroutine
allows for building a complex material model taking into account both the fabric structural parameters such as
yarn spacing, yarn cross-section shape, etc. and the yarn material properties. The test data–based fabric model

makes some simplifying assumptions but allows for nonlinear response including energy loss. The two models
are presented below in detail. Both models capture the wrinkling of fabric under compression only in a smeared
fashion.
The application of fabric material in a crash simulation is illustrated in Side curtain airbag impactor test.
Test Data–Based Fabric Materials
The fabric material model based on test data assumes that the responses along the ﬁll and the warp directions
are independent of each other and that the shear response is independent of the direct response along the yarn.
Hence, each component-wise fabric stress response depends only on the fabric strain in that component. Thus,
the overall behavior of the fabric consists of three independent component-wise responses: namely, the direct
response along the ﬁll yarn to the nominal strain in the ﬁll yarn, the direct response along the warp yarn to the
nominal strain in the warp yarn, and the shear response to the change in angle between the two yarns.
Within each component you must provide test data deﬁning the response of the fabric. To fully deﬁne the fabric
response, the test data must cover all of the following attributes:
•
Within a component, separate test data can be deﬁned for the fabric response in the tensile direction and in
the compressive direction.
•
Within a deformation direction (tension or compression), both loading and unloading test data can be provided.
•
The loading and unloading test data can be classiﬁed according to three available behavior types: nonlinear
elastic behavior, damaged elastic behavior, or elastic-plastic type behavior with permanent deformation. The
behavior type determines how the fabric transitions from its loading response to its unloading response.
When elastic, the test data in a particular component can also be rate dependent. When separate loading and
unloading paths are required, the test data for the two deformation directions (tension and compression) must
be given separately. Otherwise, the data for both tension and compression may be given in a single table.
Use the following options to deﬁne a fabric material using test data:

each component and deformation direction.
Specifying Uniaxial Behavior in a Component Direction
Independent loading and unloading test data can be provided in each of the three component directions. The
components correspond to the response along the ﬁll yarn, the response along the warp yarn, and the shear
response.

Use the following option to deﬁne the shear response:
*UNIAXIAL, COMPONENT=SHEAR
Defining the Deformation Direction
The test data can be deﬁned separately for tension and compression by specifying the deformation direction. If
the deformation direction is deﬁned (tension or compression), the tabular values deﬁning tensile or compressive
behavior should be speciﬁed with positive values of the stress and strain in the speciﬁed component and the
loading data must start at the origin. If the behavior is not deﬁned in a loading direction, the stress response will
be zero in that direction (the fabric has no resistance in that direction).
If the deformation direction is not deﬁned, the data apply to both tension and compression. However, the behavior
is then considered to be nonlinear elastic and no unloading response can be speciﬁed. The test data will be
considered to be symmetric about the origin if either tensile or compressive data are omitted.
Use the following option to deﬁne tensile behavior:
Input File Usage:
*LOADING DATA, DIRECTION=TENSION
Use the following option to deﬁne compressive behavior:
*LOADING DATA, DIRECTION=COMPRESSION
Use the following option to deﬁne both tensile and compressive behavior in a single
table:
*LOADING DATA
Compressive Behavior
In general, a fabric material does not have signiﬁcant stiffness under compression. To prevent the collapse of
wrinkled elements under compressive loading, the speciﬁed stress-strain curve should have nonzero compressive
stiffness, particularly at larger compressive strains.
Defining Loading/Unloading Component-Wise Response for a Fabric Material
To deﬁne the loading response, you specify the fabric stress as nonlinear functions of the fabric strain. This
function can also depend on temperature and ﬁeld variables. See Input Syntax Rules for further information about
deﬁning data as functions of temperature and ﬁeld variables.
The unloading response can be deﬁned in the following different ways:
•
You can specify several unloading curves that express the fabric stress as nonlinear functions of the fabric
strain; Abaqus interpolates these curves to create an unloading curve that passes through the point of unloading
in an analysis.
•
You can specify an energy dissipation factor (and a permanent deformation factor for models with permanent
deformation), from which Abaqus calculates a quadratic unloading function.
•
You can specify an energy dissipation factor (and a permanent deformation factor for models with permanent
deformation), from which Abaqus calculates an exponential unloading function.
•
You can specify the fabric stress as a nonlinear function of the fabric strain, as well as a transition slope; the
fabric unloads along the speciﬁed transition slope until it intersects the speciﬁed unloading function, at which
point it unloads according to the function. (This unloading deﬁnition is referred to as combined unloading.)
Abaqus Materials Guide

Fabric Material Behavior

•
You can specify the fabric stress as a nonlinear function of the fabric strain; Abaqus shifts the speciﬁed
unloading function along the strain axis so that it passes through the point of unloading in an analysis.
The behavior type that is speciﬁed for the fabric dictates the type of unloading you can deﬁne, as summarized
in Table 1. The different behavior types, as well as the associated loading and unloading curves, are discussed
in more detail in the sections that follow.

Defining Nonlinear Elastic Behavior
The elastic behavior can be nonlinear and, optionally, rate dependent. When the loading response is rate dependent,
a separate unloading curve can also be speciﬁed. However, the unloading response need not be rate dependent.
Defining Rate-Independent Elasticity
When the loading response is rate independent, the unloading response is also rate independent and occurs along
the same user-speciﬁed loading curve as illustrated in Figure 2. An unloading curve does not need to be speciﬁed.

Defining Rate-Dependent Elasticity
When the elastic response is rate dependent, both the loading and the unloading curves can be speciﬁed. The
unloading data can be rate independent or rate dependent and must be speciﬁed in a single table; that is, only a
single unloading data deﬁnition is allowed. If the unloading data are not speciﬁed, the unloading occurs along
the loading curve speciﬁed with the smallest rate of deformation.

Defining Models with Damage
The damage models dissipate energy upon unloading, and there is no permanent deformation upon complete
unloading. You can specify the onset of damage by deﬁning the strain above which the material response in
unloading does not retrace the loading curve.

The unloading behavior controls the amount of energy dissipated by damage mechanisms and can be speciﬁed
in one of the following ways:
•
an analytical unloading curve (exponential/quadratic);
•
an unloading curve interpolated from multiple user-speciﬁed unloading curves; or
•
unloading along a transition unloading curve (constant slope speciﬁed by user) to the user-speciﬁed unloading

Specifying Exponential/Quadratic Unloading
The damage model in Figure 4 is based on an analytical unloading curve that is derived from an energy dissipation
factor, 
 (fraction of energy that is dissipated at any strain level). As the fabric component is loaded, the stress
follows the path given by the loading curve. If the fabric component is unloaded (for example, at point B), the
stress follows the unloading curve 
. Reloading after unloading follows the unloading curve 
 until the
loading is such that the strain becomes greater than 
 , after which the loading path follows the loading curve.

The unloading response follows the loading curve when the calculated unloading curve lies above the loading
curve to prevent energy generation and follows a zero stress response when the unloading curve yields a negative
response. In such cases the dissipated energy will be less than the value speciﬁed by the energy dissipation factor.
Specifying Interpolated Curve Unloading
The damage model in Figure 5 illustrates an interpolated unloading response based on multiple unloading curves
that intersect the primary loading curve at increasing values of stress/strains. You can specify as many unloading
curves as are necessary to deﬁne the unloading response. Each unloading curve always starts at point O, the
point of zero stress and zero strains, since the damage models do not allow any permanent deformation. The
unloading curves are stored in normalized form so that they intersect the loading curve at a unit stress for a unit
strain, and the interpolation occurs between these normalized curves. If unloading occurs from a maximum strain
for which an unloading curve is not speciﬁed, the unloading is interpolated from neighboring unloading curves.
As the fabric component is loaded, the stress follows the path given by the loading curve. If the fabric is unloaded
(for example, at point B), the stress follows the unloading curve 
. Reloading after unloading follows the
unloading path 
 until the loading is such that the strain becomes greater than

path follows the loading curve.

 in addition to the loading curve 
 as
well as a constant transition slope that connects the loading curve to the unloading curve. As the fabric is loaded,
the stress follows the path given by the loading curve. If the fabric is unloaded (for example at point B) the stress

Defining Models with Permanent Deformation
These models dissipate energy upon unloading and exhibit permanent deformation upon complete unloading.
You can specify the onset of permanent deformation by deﬁning the strain below which unloading occurs along
the loading curve.
The unloading behavior controls the amount of energy dissipated as well as the amount of permanent deformation.
The unloading behavior can be speciﬁed in one of the following ways:
•
an analytical unloading curve (exponential/quadratic);
•
an unloading curve interpolated from multiple user-speciﬁed unloading curves; or

Defining the Onset of Permanent Deformation
By default, the onset of yield will be obtained as soon as the slope of the loading curve decreases by 10% from
the maximum slope recorded up to that point while traversing along the loading curve. To override the default
method of determining the onset of yield, you can specify either a value for the decrease in slope of the loading
curve other than the default value of 10% (slope drop = 0.1) or by deﬁning the strain below which unloading
occurs along the loading curve. If a slope drop is speciﬁed, the onset of yield will be obtained as soon as the
slope of the loading curve decreases by the speciﬁed factor from the maximum slope recorded up to that point.

Fabric Material Behavior

User-Defined Fabric Materials
The mechanical response of a fabric material depends on a number of micro and meso-scale parameters covering
the fabric construction and that of the individual yarns as a bundle of ﬁbers. Often a multiscale model becomes
necessary to track the state of the fabric and its response to loading. Abaqus provides a specialized user subroutine,
VFABRIC, to capture the complex fabric response given the deformed yarn directions and the strains along these
directions.
The density (Density) is required when using a fabric material.
Use the following options to deﬁne a fabric material through user subroutine
VFABRIC:
Input File Usage:
*MATERIAL, NAME=name
*FABRIC, USER
*DENSITY
Properties for a User-Defined Fabric Material
Any material constants that are needed in user subroutine VFABRIC must be speciﬁed as part of a user-deﬁned
fabric material deﬁnition. Abaqus can be used to compute the isotropic thermal expansion response under thermal
loading, even as the remaining mechanical response is deﬁned by the user subroutine. Alternatively, you can
include the thermal expansion within the deﬁnition of the mechanical response in user subroutine VFABRIC.
Use the following option to deﬁne properties for a user-deﬁned fabric material
behavior:
Input File Usage:
*FABRIC, USER, PROPERTIES=number_of_constants
Material State
Many mechanical constitutive models require the storage of solution-dependent state variables (plastic strains,
“back stress,” saturation values, etc. in rate constitutive forms or historical data for theories written in integral
form). You should allocate storage for these variables in the associated material deﬁnition (see Allocating Space
for Solution-Dependent State Variables). There is no restriction on the number of state variables associated with
a user-deﬁned fabric material.
State variables associated with VFABRIC can be output to the output database (.odb) ﬁle and results (.fil)
ﬁle using output identiﬁers SDV and SDVn (see Abaqus/Explicit Output Variable Identiﬁers).
User subroutine VFABRIC is called for blocks of material points at each increment. When the subroutine is
called, it is provided with the state at the start of the increment (fabric stress in the local system, solution-dependent
state variables). It is also provided with the nominal fabric strains at the end of the increment and the incremental
nominal fabric strains over the increment, both in the local system. The VFABRIC user material interface passes
a block of material points to the subroutine on each call, which allows vectorization of the material subroutine.
The temperature is provided to user subroutine VFABRIC at the start and the end of the increment. The temperature
is passed in as information only and cannot be modiﬁed, even in a fully coupled thermal-stress analysis. However,
if the inelastic heat fraction is deﬁned in conjunction with the speciﬁc heat and conductivity in a fully coupled
thermal-stress analysis, the heat ﬂux due to inelastic energy dissipation is calculated automatically. If user
subroutine VFABRIC is used to deﬁne an adiabatic material behavior (conversion of plastic work to heat) in an
explicit dynamic procedure, the temperatures must be stored and integrated as user-deﬁned state variables. Most
often the temperatures are provided by specifying initial conditions (Initial Conditions) and are constant throughout
the analysis.

Deleting Elements from an Abaqus/Explicit Mesh Using State Variables
Element deletion in a mesh can be controlled during the course of an Abaqus/Explicit analysis through user
subroutine VFABRIC. Deleted elements have no ability to carry stresses and, therefore, have no contribution to
the stiffness of the model. You specify the state variable number controlling the element deletion ﬂag. For
example, specifying a state variable number of 4 indicates that the fourth state variable is the deletion ﬂag in
VFABRIC. The deletion state variable should be set to a value of one or zero in VFABRIC. A value of one
indicates that the material point is active, while a value of zero indicates that Abaqus/Explicit should delete the
material point from the model by setting the stresses to zero. The structure of the block of material points passed
to user subroutine VFABRIC remains unchanged during the analysis; deleted material points are not removed
from the block. Abaqus/Explicit passes zero stresses and strain increments for all deleted material points. Once
a material point is ﬂagged as deleted, it cannot be reactivated. An element is deleted from a mesh based on the
material point status (active or deleted). Details for element deletion driven by material failure are described in
Material Failure and Element Deletion. The status of a material point and an element can be determined by
requesting output variables STATUSMP and STATUS, respectively.

Fabric Thickness
The thickness of a fabric is difﬁcult to measure experimentally. Fortunately, an accurate value for thickness is
not always required due to the fact that a nominal stress measure, deﬁned as force per unit area in the reference
conﬁguration, is used to characterize the in-plane response. An initial thickness can be speciﬁed on the section
deﬁnition. Accurate tracking of the thickness with deformation is necessary only if the material is used with
shell elements and the bending response needs to be captured accurately. You can compute the thickness direction
strain increment when the fabric is deﬁned through user subroutine VFABRIC. For test data–based fabric materials
the thickness is assumed to remain constant with deformation. For a test data–based fabric deﬁnition, you must
use the thickness value speciﬁed on the section deﬁnition for converting the experimental load data (which are
typically available as force applied per unit width of the fabric) to stress quantities.
Defining a Reference Mesh (Initial Metric)
Abaqus/Explicit allows the speciﬁcation of a reference mesh (initial metric) for fabrics modeled with membrane
elements. For example, this is useful in airbag simulations to model wrinkles and changes in yarn orientations
that arise from the airbag folding process. A ﬂat mesh may be suitable for the unstressed reference conﬁguration,
but the initial state may require a corresponding folded mesh deﬁning the folded state. The angular orientation
of the yarn in the reference conﬁguration is updated to obtain the new orientation in the initial conﬁguration.

Deﬁning a reference conﬁguration that is different from the initial conﬁguration generally results in nonzero
stresses and strains in the initial conﬁguration based on the material deﬁnition. By default, compressive initial
strains in the yarn directions generate zero stresses. The stress remains zero as the strain is continuously recovered
from the initial compressive values toward the strain-free state. Once the initial slack is recovered, any subsequent
compressive/tensile strains generate stresses as per the material deﬁnition.
Use the following option to specify that initial compressive strains are recovered
stress free (default):

Defining Yarn Directions in the Reference Configuration
In general, the yarn directions may not be orthogonal to each other in the reference conﬁguration. You can
specify these local directions with respect to the in-plane axes of an orthogonal orientation system at a material
point. Both the local directions and the orthogonal system are deﬁned together as a single orientation deﬁnition.
See Orientations for more information.
If the local directions are not speciﬁed, these directions are assumed to match the in-plane axes of the orthogonal
system deﬁned. The local direction may not remain orthogonal with deformation. Abaqus updates the local
directions with deformation and computes the nominal strains along these directions and the angle between them
(fabric shear strain). The constitutive behavior for the fabric deﬁnes the nominal stresses in the local system in
terms of the fabric strain.
Local yarn directions can be output to the output database as described in Output below.
Picture-Frame Shear Fabric Test
The shear response of the fabric is typically studied using a picture-frame shear test. The reference and the
deformed conﬁguration for a picture-frame shear test under force  is illustrated in Figure 11, where 
 is the
size of the picture-frame, and 
 is the initial angle between the yarn directions. The four sides of the specimen
are constrained not to change in their length even as the frame elongates and the angle between the yarn directions
 decreases with deformation.

Material Options
The fabric material model can be used by itself, or it can be combined with isotropic thermal expansion to
introduce thermal volume changes (Thermal Expansion). See Combining Material Behaviors for more details.
Thermal expansion can alternatively be an integral part of the constitutive model implemented in VFABRIC for
user-deﬁned fabric materials.
For a test-data based fabric material, both the mass proportional and the stiffness proportional damping can be
speciﬁed (see Material Damping). If stiffness proportional damping is speciﬁed, Abaqus calculates the damping
stress based on the current elastic stiffness of the material and the resulting damping stress is included in the
reported stress output at the integration points.
For a fabric material deﬁned by user subroutine VFABRIC, mass proportional damping can be speciﬁed, but
stiffness proportional damping must be deﬁned within the user subroutine.
Elements
The fabric material model can be used with plane stress elements (plane stress solid elements, ﬁnite-strain shells,
and membranes). It is recommended that the fabric material model be used with fully integrated or triangular
membrane elements. When the fabric material model is used with shell elements, Abaqus does not compute a
transverse shear stiffness by default. You must either specify the material transverse shear modulus (see Deﬁning
the Elastic Transverse Shear Modulus) based on which Abaqus can calculate the transverse shear stiffness or
Abaqus Materials Guide
406
Fabric Material Behavior

deﬁne the transverse shear stiffness for the section directly (see Transverse Shear Stiffness and Deﬁning the
Transverse Shear Stiffness).
Procedures
Fabric materials must always be used with geometrically nonlinear analyses (General and Perturbation
Procedures).
Output
In addition to the standard output identiﬁers available in Abaqus (Abaqus/Explicit Output Variable Identiﬁers),
the following variables have special meaning for the fabric material models:
Nominal fabric strain with components similar to that of LE, but with the direct components
measuring the nominal strain along the yarn directions and the engineering shear component
measuring the change in angle between the two yarn directions.
EFABRIC
Nominal fabric stress with components similar to that of the regular Cauchy stress, S, but
with the direct components measuring the nominal stress along the yarn directions and the
shear component measuring response to the change in angle between the two yarn directions.
SFABRIC
By default, Abaqus outputs local material directions whenever element ﬁeld output is requested to the output
database for fabric models. The local directions are output as ﬁeld variables (LOCALDIR1 and LOCALDIR2)
representing the yarn direction cosines with respect to the orthogonal system at the material point resulting from
the current orientation deﬁnition; these variables can be visualized as vector plots in the Visualization module
of Abaqus/CAE (Abaqus/Viewer).
Output of local material directions is suppressed if no element ﬁeld output is requested or if you specify not to
have element material directions written to the output database (see Specifying the Directions for Element Output).

Jointed Material Model

Abaqus/Standard
References:
• Orientations

• Inelastic Behavior
• *JOINTED MATERIAL
Overview
The jointed material model:
•
is intended to provide a simple continuum model for a material containing a high density of parallel joint surfaces
where each system of parallel joints is associated with a particular orientation, such as sedimentary rock;
•
assumes that the spacing of the joints of a particular orientation is sufﬁciently close compared to characteristic
dimensions in the domain of the model such that the joints can be smeared into a continuum of slip systems;
•
provides for opening or frictional sliding of the joints in each of these systems (a “system” in this context is a joint
orientation in a particular direction at a material calculation point); and
•
assumes that the elastic behavior of the material is isotropic and linear when all joints at a point are closed (isotropic
linear elastic behavior must be included in the material deﬁnition; see Deﬁning Isotropic Elasticity).
Joint Opening/Closing
The jointed material model is intended primarily for applications where the stresses are mainly compressive.
The model provides a joint opening capability when the stress normal to the joint tries to become tensile. In this
case the stiffness of the material normal to the joint plane becomes zero instantaneously. Abaqus/Standard uses
a stress-based joint opening criterion, whereas joint closing is monitored based on strain. Joint system a opens
when the estimated pressure stress across the joint (normal to the joint surface) is no longer positive:
In this case the material is assumed to have no elastic stiffness with respect to direct strain across the joint system.
Open joints thus create anisotropic elastic response at a point. The joint system remains open so long as
where 
 is the component of direct elastic strain across the joint and 
 is the component of direct elastic
strain across the joint calculated in plane stress as
where E is the Young's modulus of the material,  is the Poisson's ratio, and 
, 
 are the direct stresses in
the plane of the joint.
Abaqus Materials Guide
408
Jointed Material Model

The shear response of open joints is governed by the shear retention parameter, 
, which represents the fraction
of the elastic shear modulus retained when the joints are open (
=0 means no shear stiffness associated with
open joints, while 
=1 corresponds to elastic shear stiffness in open joints; any value between these two
extremes can be used). When a joint opens, the shear behavior may be brittle, depending on the shear retention
factor used for open joints. In addition, the stiffness of the material normal to the joint plane suddenly goes to
zero. For these reasons, in situations where the conﬁning stresses are low or signiﬁcant regions experience tensile
behavior, the joint systems may experience a sequence of alternate opening and closing states from iteration to
iteration. Typically such behavior manifests itself as oscillating global residual forces. The convergence rate
associated with such discontinuous behavior may be very slow and, thus, prohibit obtaining a solution. This type
of failure is more probable in cases where more than one joint system is modeled.
Improving Convergence When Joints Open and Close Repeatedly
When the repeated opening and closing of joints makes convergence difﬁcult, you can improve convergence by
preventing a joint from opening. In this case an elastic stiffness is always associated with the joint. It is most
useful when the opening and closing of joints is limited to small regions of the model. You can prevent a joint
from opening only when the joint direction is speciﬁed, as described below.

is a component of the shear stress on the joint surface,
is the dilation angle for this joint system (choosing 
 provides pure shear ﬂow on the joint, while
 causes dilation of the joint as it slips), and
is the inelastic strain normal to the joint surface.
The sliding of the different joint systems at a point is independent, in the sense that sliding on one system does
not change the failure criterion or the dilation angle for any other joint system at the same point.
Up to three joint directions can be included in the material description. The orientations of the joint directions
are given by referring to the names of user-deﬁned local orientations (Orientations) that deﬁne the joint orientations
in the original conﬁguration. Output of stress and strain components is in the global directions unless a local
orientation is also used in the material's section deﬁnition.

Joint Directions and Finite Rotations
In geometrically nonlinear analysis steps the joint directions always remain ﬁxed in space.
Bulk Failure
In addition to the joint systems, the jointed material model includes a bulk material failure mechanism, which
is based on the Drucker-Prager failure criterion:
where

Jointed Material Model

is the Mises equivalent deviatoric stress,
is the deviatoric stress,
is the equivalent pressure stress,
is the friction angle for the bulk material, and
is the cohesion for the bulk material.
If this failure criterion is reached, the bulk inelastic ﬂow is deﬁned by
where
is the ﬂow potential. Here 
 is the magnitude of the inelastic ﬂow rate (chosen so that 
 in
uniaxial compression in the 1-direction), and 
 is the dilation angle for the bulk material. This bulk failure
model is a simpliﬁed version of the extended Drucker-Prager model (Extended Drucker-Prager Models). This
bulk failure system is independent of the joint systems in that bulk inelastic ﬂow does not change the behavior
of any joint system.
If bulk material failure is to be modeled, a jointed material behavior must be speciﬁed to deﬁne the parameters
associated with bulk material failure behavior. Thus, up to ﬁve jointed material behaviors can appear in the same
material deﬁnition: three joint directions, shear retention in open joints, and bulk material failure.
The parameters 
,

 can be speciﬁed as a tabular function of temperature and/or predeﬁned ﬁeld

Nonassociated Flow
If 
 in any joint system, whether it be associated with the joint surfaces or the bulk material, the ﬂow in
that system is “nonassociated.” The implication is that the material stiffness matrix is not symmetric. Therefore,
the unsymmetric matrix solution scheme should be used for the analysis step (Deﬁning an Analysis), especially
411
Abaqus Materials Guide
Jointed Material Model

when large regions of the model are expected to ﬂow plastically and when the difference between  and  is
large. If the difference between  and  is not large, a symmetric approximation to the matrix can provide an
acceptable rate of convergence of the equilibrium equations and, hence, a lower overall solution cost. Therefore,
the unsymmetric matrix solution scheme is not invoked automatically when jointed material behavior is deﬁned.
Elements
The jointed material model can be used with plane strain, generalized plane strain, axisymmetric, and
three-dimensional solid (continuum) elements in Abaqus/Standard. This model cannot be used with elements
for which the assumed stress state is plane stress (plane stress, shell, and membrane elements).

Overview
The smeared crack concrete model in Abaqus/Standard:
•
provides a general capability for modeling concrete in all types of structures, including beams, trusses, shells, and
solids;
•
can be used for plain concrete, even though it is intended primarily for the analysis of reinforced concrete structures;
•
can be used with rebar to model concrete reinforcement;
•
is designed for applications in which the concrete is subjected to essentially monotonic straining at low conﬁning
pressures;
•
consists of an isotropically hardening yield surface that is active when the stress is dominantly compressive and
an independent “crack detection surface” that determines if a point fails by cracking;
•
uses oriented damaged elasticity concepts (smeared cracking) to describe the reversible part of the material's
response after cracking failure;
•
requires that the linear elastic material model (see Linear Elastic Behavior) be used to deﬁne elastic properties;
and
•
cannot be used with local orientations (see Orientations).
See Inelastic Behavior for a discussion of the concrete models available in Abaqus.
Reinforcement
Reinforcement in concrete structures is typically provided by means of rebars, which are one-dimensional strain
theory elements (rods) that can be deﬁned singly or embedded in oriented surfaces. Rebars are typically used
with metal plasticity models to describe the behavior of the rebar material and are superposed on a mesh of
standard element types used to model the concrete.
With this modeling approach, the concrete behavior is considered independently of the rebar. Effects associated
with the rebar/concrete interface, such as bond slip and dowel action, are modeled approximately by introducing
some “tension stiffening” into the concrete modeling to simulate load transfer across cracks through the rebar.
Details regarding tension stiffening are provided below.
Abaqus Materials Guide
414
Concrete Smeared Cracking

Deﬁning the rebar can be tedious in complex problems, but it is important that this be done accurately since it
may cause an analysis to fail due to lack of reinforcement in key regions of a model. See Deﬁning Reinforcement
for more information regarding rebars.
Cracking
The model is intended as a model of concrete behavior for relatively monotonic loadings under fairly low
conﬁning pressures (less than four to ﬁve times the magnitude of the largest stress that can be carried by the
concrete in uniaxial compression).
Crack Detection
Cracking is assumed to be the most important aspect of the behavior, and representation of cracking and of
postcracking behavior dominates the modeling. Cracking is assumed to occur when the stress reaches a failure
surface that is called the “crack detection surface.” This failure surface is a linear relationship between the
equivalent pressure stress, p, and the Mises equivalent deviatoric stress, q, and is illustrated in Figure 5. When
a crack has been detected, its orientation is stored for subsequent calculations. Subsequent cracking at the same
point is restricted to being orthogonal to this direction since stress components associated with an open crack
are not included in the deﬁnition of the failure surface used for detecting the additional cracks.
Cracks are irrecoverable: they remain for the rest of the calculation (but may open and close). No more than
three cracks can occur at any point (two in a plane stress case, one in a uniaxial stress case). Following crack
detection, the crack affects the calculations because a damaged elasticity model is used. Oriented, damaged
elasticity is discussed in more detail in An inelastic constitutive model for concrete.
Smeared Cracking
The concrete model is a smeared crack model in the sense that it does not track individual “macro” cracks.
Constitutive calculations are performed independently at each integration point of the ﬁnite element model. The
presence of cracks enters into these calculations by the way in which the cracks affect the stress and material
stiffness associated with the integration point.
Tension Stiffening
The postfailure behavior for direct straining across cracks is modeled with tension stiffening, which allows you
to deﬁne the strain-softening behavior for cracked concrete. This behavior also allows for the effects of the
reinforcement interaction with concrete to be simulated in a simple manner. Tension stiffening is required in the
concrete smeared cracking model. You can specify tension stiffening by means of a postfailure stress-strain
relation or by applying a fracture energy cracking criterion.
Postfailure Stress-Strain Relation
Speciﬁcation of strain softening behavior in reinforced concrete generally means specifying the postfailure stress
as a function of strain across the crack. In cases with little or no reinforcement this speciﬁcation often introduces
mesh sensitivity in the analysis results in the sense that the ﬁnite element predictions do not converge to a unique
solution as the mesh is reﬁned because mesh reﬁnement leads to narrower crack bands. This problem typically
occurs if only a few discrete cracks form in the structure, and mesh reﬁnement does not result in formation of
additional cracks. If cracks are evenly distributed (either due to the effect of rebar or due to the presence of
stabilizing elastic material, as in the case of plate bending), mesh sensitivity is less of a concern.
In practical calculations for reinforced concrete, the mesh is usually such that each element contains rebars. The
interaction between the rebars and the concrete tends to reduce the mesh sensitivity, provided that a reasonable
amount of tension stiffening is introduced in the concrete model to simulate this interaction (Figure 1).

Figure 1: “Tension stiffening” model.
The tension stiffening effect must be estimated; it depends on such factors as the density of reinforcement, the
quality of the bond between the rebar and the concrete, the relative size of the concrete aggregate compared to
the rebar diameter, and the mesh. A reasonable starting point for relatively heavily reinforced concrete modeled
with a fairly detailed mesh is to assume that the strain softening after failure reduces the stress linearly to zero
at a total strain of about 10 times the strain at failure. The strain at failure in standard concretes is typically 10−4,
which suggests that tension stiffening that reduces the stress to zero at a total strain of about 10−3 is reasonable.
This parameter should be calibrated to a particular case.
The choice of tension stiffening parameters is important in Abaqus/Standard since, generally, more tension
stiffening makes it easier to obtain numerical solutions. Too little tension stiffening will cause the local cracking
failure in the concrete to introduce temporarily unstable behavior in the overall response of the model. Few
practical designs exhibit such behavior, so that the presence of this type of response in the analysis model usually
indicates that the tension stiffening is unreasonably low.

Fracture Energy Cracking Criterion
As discussed earlier, when there is no reinforcement in signiﬁcant regions of a concrete model, the strain softening
approach for deﬁning tension stiffening may introduce unreasonable mesh sensitivity into the results. Crisﬁeld
(1986) discusses this issue and concludes that Hillerborg's (1976) proposal is adequate to allay the concern for
Abaqus Materials Guide
416
Concrete Smeared Cracking

many practical purposes. Hillerborg deﬁnes the energy required to open a unit area of crack as a material
parameter, using brittle fracture concepts. With this approach the concrete's brittle behavior is characterized by
a stress-displacement response rather than a stress-strain response. Under tension a concrete specimen will crack
across some section. After it has been pulled apart sufﬁciently for most of the stress to be removed (so that the
elastic strain is small), its length will be determined primarily by the opening at the crack. The opening does not
depend on the specimen's length (Figure 2).

Implementation
The implementation of this stress-displacement concept in a ﬁnite element model requires the deﬁnition of a
characteristic length associated with an integration point. The characteristic crack length is based on the element
geometry and formulation: it is a typical length of a line across an element for a ﬁrst-order element; it is half of
the same typical length for a second-order element. For beams and trusses it is a characteristic length along the
element axis. For membranes and shells it is a characteristic length in the reference surface. For axisymmetric
elements it is a characteristic length in the r–z plane only. For cohesive elements it is equal to the constitutive
thickness. This deﬁnition of the characteristic crack length is used because the direction in which cracks will
occur is not known in advance. Therefore, elements with large aspect ratios will have rather different behavior
depending on the direction in which they crack: some mesh sensitivity remains because of this effect, and elements
that are as close to square as possible are recommended.
This approach to modeling the concrete's brittle response requires the speciﬁcation of the displacement 
 at
which a linear approximation to the postfailure strain softening gives zero stress (see Figure 2).
The failure stress, 
, occurs at a failure strain (deﬁned by the failure stress divided by the Young's modulus);
however, the stress goes to zero at an ultimate displacement, 
, that is independent of the specimen length. The
implication is that a displacement-loaded specimen can remain in static equilibrium after failure only if the
specimen is short enough so that the strain at failure, 
, is less than the strain at this value of the displacement:
where L is the length of the specimen.

Obtaining the Ultimate Displacement
The ultimate displacement, 
, can be estimated from the fracture energy per unit area, 
, as 
,
where 
 is the maximum tensile stress that the concrete can carry. Typical values for 
 are 0.05 mm (2 × 10−3
in) for a normal concrete to 0.08 mm (3 × 10−3 in) for a high strength concrete. A typical value for 
 is about
10−4, so that the requirement is that 
 mm (20 in).
Critical Length
If the specimen is longer than the critical length, L, more strain energy is stored in the specimen than can be
dissipated by the cracking process when it cracks under ﬁxed displacement. Some of the strain energy must,
therefore, be converted into kinetic energy, and the failure event must be dynamic even under prescribed
displacement loading. This implies that, when this approach is used in ﬁnite elements, characteristic element
dimensions must be less than this critical length, or additional (dynamic) considerations must be included. The
analysis input ﬁle processor checks the characteristic length of each element using this concrete model and will
not allow any element to have a characteristic length that exceeds 
. You must remesh with smaller elements
where necessary or use the stress-strain deﬁnition of tension stiffening. Since the fracture energy approach is
generally used only for plain concrete, this rarely places any limit on the meshing.
Cracked Shear Retention
As the concrete cracks, its shear stiffness is diminished. This effect is deﬁned by specifying the reduction in the
shear modulus as a function of the opening strain across the crack. You can also specify a reduced shear modulus
for closed cracks. This reduced shear modulus will also have an effect when the normal stress across a crack
becomes compressive. The new shear stiffness will have been degraded by the presence of the crack.
The modulus for shearing of cracks is deﬁned as 
, where G is the elastic shear modulus of the uncracked
concrete and  is a multiplying factor. The shear retention model assumes that the shear stiffness of open cracks
reduces linearly to zero as the crack opening increases:
where  is the direct strain across the crack and 
 is a user-speciﬁed value. The model also assumes that
cracks that subsequently close have a reduced shear modulus:
where you specify 
.
 and 
 can be deﬁned with an optional dependency on temperature and/or predeﬁned ﬁeld variables. If
shear retention is not included in the material deﬁnition for the concrete smeared cracking model, Abaqus/Standard
will automatically invoke the default behavior for shear retention such that the shear response is unaffected by
cracking (full shear retention). This assumption is often reasonable: in many cases, the overall response is not
strongly dependent on the amount of shear retention.

Compressive Behavior
When the principal stress components are dominantly compressive, the response of the concrete is modeled by
an elastic-plastic theory using a simple form of yield surface written in terms of the equivalent pressure stress,
p, and the Mises equivalent deviatoric stress, q; this surface is illustrated in Figure 5. Associated ﬂow and
isotropic hardening are used. This model signiﬁcantly simpliﬁes the actual behavior. The associated ﬂow
assumption generally over-predicts the inelastic volume strain. The yield surface cannot be matched accurately
to data in triaxial tension and triaxial compression tests because of the omission of third stress invariant
dependence. When the concrete is strained beyond the ultimate stress point, the assumption that the elastic
response is not affected by the inelastic deformation is not realistic. In addition, when concrete is subjected to
very high pressure stress, it exhibits inelastic response: no attempt has been made to build this behavior into the
model.
The simpliﬁcations associated with compressive behavior are introduced for the sake of computational efﬁciency.
In particular, while the assumption of associated ﬂow is not justiﬁed by experimental data, it can provide results
that are acceptably close to measurements, provided that the range of pressure stress in the problem is not large.
From a computational viewpoint, the associated ﬂow assumption leads to enough symmetry in the Jacobian
matrix of the integrated constitutive model (the “material stiffness matrix”) such that the overall equilibrium
equation solution usually does not require unsymmetric equation solution. All of these limitations could be
removed at some sacriﬁce in computational cost.
You can deﬁne the stress-strain behavior of plain concrete in uniaxial compression outside the elastic range.
Compressive stress data are provided as a tabular function of plastic strain and, if desired, temperature and ﬁeld
variables. Positive (absolute) values should be given for the compressive stress and strain. The stress-strain curve
can be deﬁned beyond the ultimate stress, into the strain-softening regime.

Figure 3: Uniaxial behavior of plain concrete.
When concrete is loaded in compression, it initially exhibits elastic response. As the stress is increased, some
nonrecoverable (inelastic) straining occurs and the response of the material softens. An ultimate stress is reached,
after which the material loses strength until it can no longer carry any stress. If the load is removed at some point
after inelastic straining has occurred, the unloading response is softer than the initial elastic response: the elasticity
has been damaged. This effect is ignored in the model, since we assume that the applications involve primarily
monotonic straining, with only occasional, minor unloadings. When a uniaxial concrete specimen is loaded in
tension, it responds elastically until, at a stress that is typically 7%–10% of the ultimate compressive stress,
cracks form. Cracks form so quickly that, even in the stiffest testing machines available, it is very difﬁcult to
observe the actual behavior. The model assumes that cracking causes damage, in the sense that open cracks can
be represented by a loss of elastic stiffness. It is also assumed that there is no permanent strain associated with
cracking. This will allow cracks to close completely if the stress across them becomes compressive.
In multiaxial stress states these observations are generalized through the concept of surfaces of failure and ﬂow
in stress space. These surfaces are ﬁtted to experimental data. The surfaces used are shown in Figure 4 and
Figure 5.

Response to Strain Reversals
Because the model is intended for application to problems involving relatively monotonic straining, no attempt
is made to include prediction of cyclic response or of the reduction in the elastic stiffness caused by inelastic
straining under predominantly compressive stress. Nevertheless, it is likely that, even in those applications for
which the model is designed, the strain trajectories will not be entirely radial, so that the model should predict
the response to occasional strain reversals and strain trajectory direction changes in a reasonable way. Isotropic
hardening of the “compressive” yield surface forms the basis of this aspect of the model's inelastic response
prediction when the principal stresses are dominantly compressive.
Calibration
A minimum of two experiments, uniaxial compression and uniaxial tension, is required to calibrate the simplest
version of the concrete model (using all possible defaults and assuming temperature and ﬁeld variable
independence). Other experiments may be required to gain accuracy in postfailure behavior.
Uniaxial Compression and Tension Tests
The uniaxial compression test involves compressing the sample between two rigid platens. The load and
displacement in the direction of loading are recorded. From this, you can extract the stress-strain curve required
for the concrete model directly. The uniaxial tension test is much more difﬁcult to perform in the sense that it
is necessary to have a stiff testing machine to be able to record the postfailure response. Quite often this test is
not available, and you make an assumption about the tensile failure strength of the concrete (usually about
7%–10% of the compressive strength). The choice of tensile cracking stress is important; numerical problems
may arise if very low cracking stresses are used (less than 1/100 or 1/1000 of the compressive strength).
Postcracking Tensile Behavior
The calibration of the postfailure response depends on the reinforcement present in the concrete. For plain
concrete simulations the stress-displacement tension stiffening model should be used. Typical values for 
 are
0.05 mm (2 × 10−3 in) for a normal concrete to 0.08 mm (3 × 10−3 in) for a high-strength concrete. For reinforced
concrete simulations the stress-strain tension stiffening model should be used. A reasonable starting point for
relatively heavily reinforced concrete modeled with a fairly detailed mesh is to assume that the strain softening

after failure reduces the stress linearly to zero at a total strain of about 10 times the strain at failure. Since the
strain at failure in standard concretes is typically 10−4, this suggests that tension stiffening that reduces the stress
to zero at a total strain of about 10−3 is reasonable. This parameter should be calibrated to a particular case.
Postcracking Shear Behavior
Combined tension and shear experiments are used to calibrate the postcracking shear behavior in Abaqus/Standard.
These experiments are quite difﬁcult to perform. If the test data are not available, a reasonable starting point is
to assume that the shear retention factor, , goes linearly to zero at the same crack opening strain used for the
tension stiffening model.
Biaxial Yield and Flow Parameters
Biaxial experiments are required to calibrate the biaxial yield and ﬂow parameters used to specify the failure
ratios. If these are not available, the defaults can be used.
Temperature Dependence
The calibration of temperature dependence requires the repetition of all the above experiments over the range
of interest.
Comparison with Experimental Results
With proper calibration, the concrete model should produce reasonable results for mostly monotonic loadings.
Comparison of the predictions of the model with the experimental results of Kupfer and Gerstle (1973) are shown
in Figure 6 and Figure 7.

Elements
Abaqus/Standard offers a variety of elements for use with the smeared crack concrete model: beam, shell, plane
stress, plane strain, generalized plane strain, axisymmetric, and three-dimensional elements.
For general shell analysis more than the default number of ﬁve integration points through the thickness of the
shell should be used; nine thickness integration points are commonly used to model progressive failure of the
concrete through the thickness with acceptable accuracy.

Overview
The brittle cracking model in Abaqus/Explicit:
•
provides a capability for modeling concrete in all types of structures: beams, trusses, shells and solids;
•
can also be useful for modeling other materials such as ceramics or brittle rocks;
•
is designed for applications in which the behavior is dominated by tensile cracking;
•
assumes that the compressive behavior is always linear elastic;
•
must be used with the linear elastic material model (Linear Elastic Behavior), which also deﬁnes the material
behavior completely prior to cracking;
•
is most accurate in applications where the brittle behavior dominates such that the assumption that the material is
linear elastic in compression is adequate;
•
can be used for plain concrete, even though it is intended primarily for the analysis of reinforced concrete structures;
•
allows removal of elements based on a brittle failure criterion; and
•
is deﬁned in detail in A cracking model for concrete and other brittle materials.
See Inelastic Behavior for a discussion of the concrete models available in Abaqus.
Reinforcement
Reinforcement in concrete structures is typically provided by means of rebars. Rebars are one-dimensional strain
theory elements (rods) that can be deﬁned singly or embedded in oriented surfaces. Rebars are discussed in
Deﬁning Rebar as an Element Property. They are typically used with elastic-plastic material behavior and are
superposed on a mesh of standard element types used to model the plain concrete. With this modeling approach,
the concrete cracking behavior is considered independently of the rebar. Effects associated with the rebar/concrete
interface, such as bond slip and dowel action, are modeled approximately by introducing some “tension stiffening”
into the concrete cracking model to simulate load transfer across cracks through the rebar.
Cracking
Abaqus/Explicit uses a smeared crack model to represent the discontinuous brittle behavior in concrete. It does
not track individual “macro” cracks: instead, constitutive calculations are performed independently at each
material point of the ﬁnite element model. The presence of cracks enters into these calculations by the way in
which the cracks affect the stress and material stiffness associated with the material point.
427
Cracking Model for Concrete

For simplicity of discussion in this section, the term “crack” is used to mean a direction in which cracking has
been detected at the single material calculation point in question: the closest physical concept is that there exists
a continuum of micro-cracks in the neighborhood of the point, oriented as determined by the model. The anisotropy
introduced by cracking is assumed to be important in the simulations for which the model is intended.
Crack Directions
The Abaqus/Explicit cracking model assumes ﬁxed, orthogonal cracks, with the maximum number of cracks at
a material point limited by the number of direct stress components present at that material point of the ﬁnite
element model (a maximum of three cracks in three-dimensional, plane strain, and axisymmetric problems; two
cracks in plane stress and shell problems; and one crack in beam or truss problems). Internally, once cracks exist
at a point, the component forms of all vector- and tensor-valued quantities are rotated so that they lie in the local
system deﬁned by the crack orientation vectors (the normals to the crack faces). The model ensures that these
crack face normal vectors will be orthogonal, so that this local crack system is rectangular Cartesian. For output
purposes you are offered results of stresses and strains in the global and/or local crack systems.
Crack Detection
A simple Rankine criterion is used to detect crack initiation. This criterion states that a crack forms when the
maximum principal tensile stress exceeds the tensile strength of the brittle material. Although crack detection
is based purely on Mode I fracture considerations, ensuing cracked behavior includes both Mode I (tension
softening/stiffening) and Mode II (shear softening/retention) behavior, as described later.
As soon as the Rankine criterion for crack formation has been met, we assume that a ﬁrst crack has formed. The
crack surface is taken to be normal to the direction of the maximum tensile principal stress. Subsequent cracks
may form with crack surface normals in the direction of maximum principal tensile stress that is orthogonal to
the directions of any existing crack surface normals at the same point.
Cracking is irrecoverable in the sense that, once a crack has occurred at a point, it remains throughout the rest
of the calculation. However, crack closing and reopening may take place along the directions of the crack surface
normals. The model neglects any permanent strain associated with cracking; that is, it is assumed that the cracks
can close completely when the stress across them becomes compressive.
Tension Stiffening
You can specify the postfailure behavior for direct straining across cracks by means of a postfailure stress-strain
relation or by applying a fracture energy cracking criterion.
Postfailure Stress-Strain Relation
In reinforced concrete the speciﬁcation of postfailure behavior generally means giving the postfailure stress as
a function of strain across the crack (Figure 1). In cases with little or no reinforcement, this introduces mesh
sensitivity in the results, in the sense that the ﬁnite element predictions do not converge to a unique solution as
the mesh is reﬁned because mesh reﬁnement leads to narrower crack bands.

In practical calculations for reinforced concrete, the mesh is usually such that each element contains rebars. In
this case the interaction between the rebars and the concrete tends to mitigate this effect, provided that a reasonable
amount of “tension stiffening” is introduced in the cracking model to simulate this interaction. This requires an
estimate of the tension stiffening effect, which depends on factors such as the density of reinforcement, the
quality of the bond between the rebar and the concrete, the relative size of the concrete aggregate compared to
the rebar diameter, and the mesh. A reasonable starting point for relatively heavily reinforced concrete modeled
with a fairly detailed mesh is to assume that the strain softening after failure reduces the stress linearly to zero
at a total strain about ten times the strain at failure. Since the strain at failure in standard concretes is typically
10−4, this suggests that tension stiffening that reduces the stress to zero at a total strain of about 10−3 is reasonable.
This parameter should be calibrated to each particular case. In static applications too little tension stiffening will
cause the local cracking failure in the concrete to introduce temporarily unstable behavior in the overall response
of the model. Few practical designs exhibit such behavior, so that the presence of this type of response in the
analysis model usually indicates that the tension stiffening is unreasonably low.

Fracture Energy Cracking Criterion
When there is no reinforcement in signiﬁcant regions of the model, the tension stiffening approach described
above will introduce unreasonable mesh sensitivity into the results. However, it is generally accepted that
Hillerborg's (1976) fracture energy proposal is adequate to allay the concern for many practical purposes.
Hillerborg deﬁnes the energy required to open a unit area of crack in Mode I (
) as a material parameter, using
brittle fracture concepts. With this approach the concrete's brittle behavior is characterized by a stress-displacement
response rather than a stress-strain response. Under tension a concrete specimen will crack across some section;
and its length, after it has been pulled apart sufﬁciently for most of the stress to be removed (so that the elastic
strain is small), will be determined primarily by the opening at the crack, which does not depend on the specimen's
length.
Implementation
In Abaqus/Explicit this fracture energy cracking model can be invoked by specifying the postfailure stress as a
tabular function of displacement across the crack, as illustrated in Figure 2.

geometry and formulation: it is a typical length of a line across an element for a ﬁrst-order element; it is half of
the same typical length for a second-order element. For beams and trusses it is a characteristic length along the
element axis. For membranes and shells it is a characteristic length in the reference surface. For axisymmetric
elements it is a characteristic length in the r–z plane only. For cohesive elements it is equal to the constitutive
thickness. We use this deﬁnition of the characteristic crack length because the direction in which cracks will
occur is not known in advance. Therefore, elements with large aspect ratios will have rather different behavior
depending on the direction in which they crack: some mesh sensitivity remains because of this effect. Elements
that are as close to square as possible are, therefore, recommended unless you can predict the direction in which
cracks will form. Alternatively, this mesh dependency could be reduced by directly specifying the characteristic
length as a function of the element topology and material orientation in user subroutine VUCHARLENGTH (see
Deﬁning the Characteristic Element Length at a Material Point in Abaqus/Explicit).
Shear Retention Model
An important feature of the cracking model is that, whereas crack initiation is based on Mode I fracture only,
postcracked behavior includes Mode II as well as Mode I. The Mode II shear behavior is based on the common
observation that the shear behavior depends on the amount of crack opening. More speciﬁcally, the cracked
shear modulus is reduced as the crack opens. Therefore, Abaqus/Explicit offers a shear retention model in which
the postcracked shear stiffness is deﬁned as a function of the opening strain across the crack; the shear retention
model must be deﬁned in the cracking model, and zero shear retention should not be used.
In these models the dependence is deﬁned by expressing the postcracking shear modulus, 
, as a fraction of
the uncracked shear modulus:
where G is the shear modulus of the uncracked material and the shear retention factor, 
, depends on the
crack opening strain, 
. You can specify this dependence in piecewise linear form, as shown in Figure 4.

Calibration
One experiment, a uniaxial tension test, is required to calibrate the simplest version of the brittle cracking model.
Other experiments may be required to gain accuracy in postfailure behavior.
Uniaxial Tension Test
This test is difﬁcult to perform because it is necessary to have a very stiff testing machine to record the
postcracking response. Quite often such equipment is not available; in this situation you must make an assumption
about the tensile failure strength of the material and the postcracking response. For concrete the assumption
usually made is that the tensile strength is 7–10% of the compressive strength. Uniaxial compression tests can
be performed much more easily, so the compressive strength of concrete is usually known.
Postcracking Tensile Behavior
The values given for tension stiffening are a very important aspect of simulations using the Abaqus/Explicit
brittle cracking model. The postcracking tensile response is highly dependent on the reinforcement present in
the concrete. In simulations of unreinforced concrete, the tension stiffening models that are based on fracture
energy concepts should be utilized. If reliable experimental data are not available, typical values that can be used
were discussed before: common values of 
 range from 40 N/m (0.22 lb/in) for a typical construction concrete
(with a compressive strength of approximately 20 MPa, 2850 lb/in2) to 120 N/m (0.67 lb/in) for a high-strength
concrete (with a compressive strength of approximately 40 MPa, 5700 lb/in2). In simulations of reinforced
concrete the stress-strain tension stiffening model should be used; the amount of tension stiffening depends on
the reinforcement present, as discussed before. A reasonable starting point for relatively heavily reinforced
Abaqus Materials Guide
432
Cracking Model for Concrete

concrete modeled with a fairly detailed mesh is to assume that the strain softening after failure reduces the stress
linearly to zero at a total strain about ten times the strain at failure. Since the strain at failure in standard concretes
is typically 10−4, this suggests that tension stiffening that reduces the stress to zero at a total strain of about 10−3
is reasonable. This parameter should be calibrated to each particular case.
Postcracking Shear Behavior
Calibration of the postcracking shear behavior requires combined tension and shear experiments, which are
difﬁcult to perform. If such test data are not available, a reasonable starting point is to assume that the shear
retention factor, , goes linearly to zero at the same crack opening strain used for the tension stiffening model.
Brittle Failure Criterion
You can deﬁne brittle failure of the material. When one, two, or all three local direct cracking strain (displacement)
components at a material point reach the value deﬁned as the failure strain (displacement), the material point
fails and all the stress components are set to zero. An element is removed from a mesh upon material failure.
Details for element deletion driven by material failure are described in Material Failure and Element Deletion.
The status of a material point and an element can be determined by requesting output variables STATUSMP
and STATUS, respectively.
If the postfailure relation is deﬁned in terms of stress versus strain, the failure strain must be given as the failure
criterion. If the postfailure relation is deﬁned in terms of stress versus displacement or stress versus fracture
energy, the failure displacement must be given as the failure criterion. The failure strain (displacement) can be
speciﬁed as a function of temperature and/or predeﬁned ﬁeld variables.
You can control how many cracks at a material point must fail before the material point is considered to have
failed; the default is one crack. The number of cracks that must fail can only be one for beam and truss elements;
it cannot be greater than two for plane stress and shell elements; and it cannot be greater than three otherwise.

Determining When to Use the Brittle Failure Criterion
The brittle failure criterion is a crude way of modeling failure in Abaqus/Explicit and should be used with care.
The main motivation for including this capability is to help in computations where not removing an element that
can no longer carry stress may lead to excessive distortion of that element and subsequent premature termination
of the simulation. For example, in a monotonically loaded structure whose failure mechanism is expected to be
dominated by a single tensile macrofracture (Mode I cracking), it may be reasonable to use the brittle failure
criterion to remove elements. On the other hand, the fact that the brittle material loses its ability to carry tensile
stress does not preclude it from withstanding compressive stress; therefore, it may not be appropriate to remove
elements if the material is expected to carry compressive loads after it has failed in tension. An example may be
a shear wall subjected to cyclic loading as a result of some earthquake excitation; in this case cracks that develop
completely under tensile stress will be able to carry compressive stress when load reversal takes place.
Thus, the effective use of the brittle failure criterion relies on you having some knowledge of the structural
behavior and potential failure mechanism. The use of the brittle failure criterion based on an incorrect user
assumption of the failure mechanism will generally result in an incorrect simulation.

Abaqus Materials Guide
Cracking Model for Concrete

Selecting the Number of Cracks That Must Fail before the Material Point Is Considered to Have
Failed
When you deﬁne brittle failure, you can control how many cracks must open to beyond the failure value before
a material point is considered to have failed. The default number of cracks (one) should be used for most structural
applications where failure is dominated by Mode I type cracking. However, there are cases in which you should
specify a higher number because multiple cracks need to form to develop the eventual failure mechanism. One
example may be an unreinforced, deep concrete beam where the failure mechanism is dominated by shear; in
this case it is possible that two cracks need to form at each material point for the shear failure mechanism to
develop.
Again, the appropriate choice of the number of cracks that must fail relies on your knowledge of the structural
and failure behaviors.
Using Brittle Failure with Rebar
It is possible to use the brittle failure criterion in brittle cracking elements for which rebar are also deﬁned; the
obvious application is the modeling of reinforced concrete. When such elements fail according to the brittle
failure criterion, the brittle cracking contribution to the element stress carrying capacity is removed but the rebar
contribution to the element stress carrying capacity is not removed. However, if you also include shear failure
in the rebar material deﬁnition, the rebar contribution to the element stress carrying capacity will also be removed
if the shear failure criterion speciﬁed for the rebar is satisﬁed. This allows the modeling of progressive failure
of an under-reinforced concrete structure where the concrete fails ﬁrst followed by ductile failure of the
reinforcement.
Elements
Abaqus/Explicit offers a variety of elements for use with the cracking model: truss; shell; two-dimensional beam;
and plane stress, plane strain, axisymmetric, and three-dimensional continuum elements. The model cannot be
used with pipe and three-dimensional beam elements. Plane triangular, triangular prism, and tetrahedral elements
are not recommended for use in reinforced concrete analysis since these elements do not support the use of rebar.

The concrete damaged plasticity model in Abaqus:
•
provides a general capability for modeling concrete and other quasi-brittle materials in all types of structures (beams,
trusses, shells, and solids);

uses concepts of isotropic damaged elasticity in combination with isotropic tensile and compressive plasticity to
represent the inelastic behavior of concrete;
•
can be used for plain concrete, even though it is intended primarily for the analysis of reinforced concrete structures;
•
can be used with rebar to model concrete reinforcement;
•
is designed for applications in which concrete is subjected to monotonic, cyclic, and/or dynamic loading under low
conﬁning pressures;
•
consists of the combination of nonassociated multi-hardening plasticity and scalar (isotropic) damaged elasticity
to describe the irreversible damage that occurs during the fracturing process;
•
allows user control of stiffness recovery effects during cyclic load reversals;
•
allows removal of elements based on material failure criteria;
•
can be deﬁned to be sensitive to the rate of straining;
•
can be used in conjunction with a viscoplastic regularization of the constitutive equations in Abaqus/Standard to
improve the convergence rate in the softening regime;
•
requires that the elastic behavior of the material be isotropic and linear (see Deﬁning Isotropic Elasticity); and

mechanisms are tensile cracking and compressive crushing of the concrete material. The evolution of the yield

Figure 1: Response of concrete to uniaxial loading in tension (a) and compression (b).
Under uniaxial tension the stress-strain response follows a linear elastic relationship until the value of the failure
stress, 
, is reached. The failure stress corresponds to the onset of micro-cracking in the concrete material.
Beyond the failure stress the formation of micro-cracks is represented macroscopically with a softening stress-strain
response, which induces strain localization in the concrete structure. Under uniaxial compression the response
is linear until the value of initial yield, 
. In the plastic regime the response is typically characterized by stress
hardening followed by strain softening beyond the ultimate stress, 
. This representation, although somewhat
simpliﬁed, captures the main features of the response of concrete.

It is assumed that the uniaxial stress-strain curves can be converted into stress versus plastic-strain curves. (This
conversion is performed automatically by Abaqus from the user-provided stress versus “inelastic” strain data,
as explained below.) Thus,

predeﬁned ﬁeld variables.
As shown in Figure 1, when the concrete specimen is unloaded from any point on the strain softening branch
of the stress-strain curves, the unloading response is weakened: the elastic stiffness of the material appears to
be damaged (or degraded). The degradation of the elastic stiffness is characterized by two damage variables, 
and 
, which are assumed to be functions of the plastic strains, temperature, and ﬁeld variables:
The damage variables can take values from zero, representing the undamaged material, to one, which represents
total loss of strength.
If 
 is the initial (undamaged) elastic stiffness of the material, the stress-strain relations under uniaxial tension
and compression loading are, respectively:
We deﬁne the “effective” tensile and compressive cohesion stresses as
The effective cohesion stresses determine the size of the yield (or failure) surface.
Uniaxial Cyclic Behavior
Under uniaxial cyclic loading conditions the degradation mechanisms are quite complex, involving the opening
and closing of previously formed micro-cracks, as well as their interaction. Experimentally, it is observed that
there is some recovery of the elastic stiffness as the load changes sign during a uniaxial cyclic test. The stiffness
recovery effect, also known as the “unilateral effect,” is an important aspect of the concrete behavior under cyclic
loading. The effect is usually more pronounced as the load changes from tension to compression, causing tensile
cracks to close, which results in the recovery of the compressive stiffness.
The concrete damaged plasticity model assumes that the reduction of the elastic modulus is given in terms of a
scalar degradation variable d as
where 
 is the initial (undamaged) modulus of the material.

This expression holds both in the tensile (
) and the compressive (
) sides of the cycle. The stiffness
degradation variable, d, is a function of the stress state and the uniaxial damage variables, 
 and 
. For the
uniaxial cyclic conditions Abaqus assumes that

Multiaxial Behavior
The stress-strain relations for the general three-dimensional multiaxial condition are given by the scalar damage
elasticity equation:
where 
 is the initial (undamaged) elasticity matrix.
The previous expression for the scalar stiffness degradation variable, d, is generalized to the multiaxial stress
case by replacing the unit step function

, deﬁned as
where 
 are the principal stress components. The Macauley bracket 
 is deﬁned by

See Damaged plasticity model for concrete and other quasi-brittle materials for further details of the constitutive
model.
Reinforcement
In Abaqus reinforcement in concrete structures is typically provided by means of rebars, which are one-dimensional
rods that can be deﬁned singly or embedded in oriented surfaces. Rebars are typically used with metal plasticity
models to describe the behavior of the rebar material and are superposed on a mesh of standard element types
used to model the concrete.
With this modeling approach, the concrete behavior is considered independently of the rebar. Effects associated
with the rebar/concrete interface, such as bond slip and dowel action, are modeled approximately by introducing
some “tension stiffening” into the concrete modeling to simulate load transfer across cracks through the rebar.
Details regarding tension stiffening are provided below.
Deﬁning the rebar can be tedious in complex problems, but it is important that this be done accurately since it
may cause an analysis to fail due to lack of reinforcement in key regions of a model. See Deﬁning Rebar as an
Element Property for more information regarding rebars.
Defining Tension Stiffening
The postfailure behavior for direct straining is modeled with tension stiffening, which allows you to deﬁne the
strain-softening behavior for cracked concrete. This behavior also allows for the effects of the reinforcement
interaction with concrete to be simulated in a simple manner. Tension stiffening is required in the concrete
damaged plasticity model. You can specify tension stiffening by means of a postfailure stress-strain relation or
by applying a fracture energy cracking criterion.
Postfailure Stress-Strain Relation
In reinforced concrete the speciﬁcation of postfailure behavior generally means giving the postfailure stress as
a function of cracking strain, 
. The cracking strain is deﬁned as the total strain minus the elastic strain
corresponding to the undamaged material; that is, 
, where 
, as illustrated in Figure

one-hundreth of the initial failure stress:

stiffening data.
Tension stiffening data are given in terms of the cracking strain, 
. When unloading data are available, the
data are provided to Abaqus in terms of tensile damage curves, 
, as discussed below. Abaqus automatically
converts the cracking strain values to plastic strain values using the relationship
Abaqus will issue an error message if the calculated plastic strain values are negative and/or decreasing with
increasing cracking strain, which typically indicates that the tensile damage curves are incorrect. In the absence
of tensile damage 
.
In cases with little or no reinforcement, the speciﬁcation of a postfailure stress-strain relation introduces mesh
sensitivity in the results, in the sense that the ﬁnite element predictions do not converge to a unique solution as
the mesh is reﬁned because mesh reﬁnement leads to narrower crack bands. This problem typically occurs if
cracking failure occurs only at localized regions in the structure and mesh reﬁnement does not result in the
formation of additional cracks. If cracking failure is distributed evenly (either due to the effect of rebar or due
to the presence of stabilizing elastic material, as in the case of plate bending), mesh sensitivity is less of a concern.
In practical calculations for reinforced concrete, the mesh is usually such that each element contains rebars. The
interaction between the rebars and the concrete tends to reduce the mesh sensitivity, provided that a reasonable
amount of tension stiffening is introduced in the concrete model to simulate this interaction. This requires an
estimate of the tension stiffening effect, which depends on such factors as the density of reinforcement, the
quality of the bond between the rebar and the concrete, the relative size of the concrete aggregate compared to
the rebar diameter, and the mesh. A reasonable starting point for relatively heavily reinforced concrete modeled
with a fairly detailed mesh is to assume that the strain softening after failure reduces the stress linearly to zero
at a total strain of about 10 times the strain at failure. The strain at failure in standard concretes is typically 10−4,
441
Abaqus Materials Guide
Concrete Damaged Plasticity

which suggests that tension stiffening that reduces the stress to zero at a total strain of about 10−3 is reasonable.
This parameter should be calibrated to a particular case.
The choice of tension stiffening parameters is important since, generally, more tension stiffening makes it easier
to obtain numerical solutions. Too little tension stiffening will cause the local cracking failure in the concrete
to introduce temporarily unstable behavior in the overall response of the model. Few practical designs exhibit
such behavior, so that the presence of this type of response in the analysis model usually indicates that the tension
stiffening is unreasonably low.

Fracture Energy Cracking Criterion
When there is no reinforcement in signiﬁcant regions of the model, the tension stiffening approach described
above will introduce unreasonable mesh sensitivity into the results. However, it is generally accepted that
Hillerborg's (1976) fracture energy proposal is adequate to allay the concern for many practical purposes.
Hillerborg deﬁnes the energy required to open a unit area of crack, 
, as a material parameter, using brittle
fracture concepts. With this approach the concrete's brittle behavior is characterized by a stress-displacement
response rather than a stress-strain response. Under tension a concrete specimen will crack across some section.
After it has been pulled apart sufﬁciently for most of the stress to be removed (so that the undamaged elastic
strain is small), its length will be determined primarily by the opening at the crack. The opening does not depend
on the specimen's length.
This fracture energy cracking model can be invoked by specifying the postfailure stress as a tabular function of
cracking displacement, as shown in Figure 4.

Alternatively, the fracture energy,

failure stress,

strength after cracking, as shown in Figure 5.

The cracking displacement at which complete loss of strength takes place is, therefore,

values of 
 range from 40 N/m (0.22 lb/in) for a typical construction concrete (with a compressive strength of
approximately 20 MPa, 2850 lb/in2) to 120 N/m (0.67 lb/in) for a high-strength concrete (with a compressive
strength of approximately 40 MPa, 5700 lb/in2).
If tensile damage,

displacement values using the relationship

units.

Input File Usage:
Specifying the specimen length is not supported in Abaqus/CAE.
Abaqus/CAE Usage:
Implementation
The implementation of this stress-displacement concept in a ﬁnite element model requires the deﬁnition of a
characteristic length associated with an integration point. The characteristic crack length is based on the element
geometry and formulation: it is a typical length of a line across an element for a ﬁrst-order element; it is half of
the same typical length for a second-order element. For beams and trusses it is a characteristic length along the
element axis. For membranes and shells it is a characteristic length in the reference surface. For axisymmetric
elements it is a characteristic length in the r–z plane only. For cohesive elements it is equal to the constitutive
thickness. This deﬁnition of the characteristic crack length is used because the direction in which cracking occurs
is not known in advance. Therefore, elements with large aspect ratios will have rather different behavior depending
on the direction in which they crack: some mesh sensitivity remains because of this effect, and elements that
have aspect ratios close to one are recommended. Alternatively, this mesh dependency could be reduced by
directly specifying the characteristic length as a function of the element topology and material orientation in
user subroutine VUCHARLENGTH (see Deﬁning the Characteristic Element Length at a Material Point in
Abaqus/Explicit).

Defining Damage and Stiffness Recovery
Damage, 
 and/or

plasticity model; consequently, 
 and 
.)
In Abaqus the damage variables are treated as non-decreasing material point quantities. At any increment during
the analysis, the new value of each damage variable is obtained as the maximum between the value at the end
of the previous increment and the value corresponding to the current state (interpolated from the user-speciﬁed
tabular data); that is,
The choice of the damage properties is important since, generally, excessive damage may have a critical effect
on the rate of convergence. It is recommended to avoid using values of the damage variables above 0.99, which
corresponds to a 99% reduction of the stiffness.
It is strongly recommended that you specify the tabular deﬁnition of tensile and compressive damage variables
for the same values of cracking and inelastic strains/displacements as those used in the tabular deﬁnitions of
tension stiffening and compressive behavior, respectively. When the tensile stiffening response is deﬁned directly
in terms of failure stress and fracture energy (
), the deﬁnition of the tension damage variable should be such
that it increases linearly as a function of the cracking displacement.

The experimental observation in most quasi-brittle materials, including concrete, is that the compressive stiffness
is recovered upon crack closure as the load changes from tension to compression. On the other hand, the tensile
stiffness is not recovered as the load changes from compression to tension once crushing micro-cracks have
developed. This behavior, which corresponds to

Defining Material Failure Criteria in Abaqus/Explicit
In Abaqus/Explicit you can deﬁne material failure for the concrete damaged plasticity model based on the
following criteria:
•
Tensile cracking strain criterion, 
, or tensile cracking displacement criterion, 
;
•
Compressive inelastic strain criterion, 
;
•
Tensile damage variable criterion, 
, if a tensile damage behavior is deﬁned; and
•
Compressive damage variable criterion, 
, if a compressive damage behavior is deﬁned.
If you specify a positive value at failure for the quantity of a criterion, the criterion is considered during the
analysis. When any criterion at a material point is met, the material point fails and all stress components are set
to zero. By default, an element is deleted from a mesh upon material failure. Details for element deletion driven
by material failure are described in Material Failure and Element Deletion. The status of a material point and
an element can be determined by requesting output variables STATUSMP and STATUS, respectively.

The rate-sensitive behavior of quasi-brittle materials is mainly connected to the retardation effects that high
strain rates have on the growth of micro-cracks. The effect is usually more pronounced under tensile loading.
As the strain rate increases, the stress-strain curves exhibit decreasing nonlinearity as well as an increase in the
peak strength. You can specify tension stiffening as a tabular function of cracking strain (or displacement) rate,

Abaqus Materials Guide

is a parameter, referred to as the eccentricity, that deﬁnes the rate at which the function approaches the
asymptote (the ﬂow potential tends to a straight line as the eccentricity tends to zero).
This ﬂow potential, which is continuous and smooth, ensures that the ﬂow direction is always uniquely deﬁned.
The function approaches the linear Drucker-Prager ﬂow potential asymptotically at high conﬁning pressure
stress and intersects the hydrostatic pressure axis at 90°. See Models for granular or polymer behavior for further
discussion of this potential.
The default ﬂow potential eccentricity is 
, which implies that the material has almost the same dilation
angle over a wide range of conﬁning pressure stress values. Increasing the value of  provides more curvature
to the ﬂow potential, implying that the dilation angle increases more rapidly as the conﬁning pressure decreases.
Values of  that are signiﬁcantly less than the default value may lead to convergence problems if the material is
subjected to low conﬁning pressures because of the very tight curvature of the ﬂow potential locally where it
intersects the p-axis.
Yield Function
The model makes use of the yield function of Lubliner et. al. (1989), with the modiﬁcations proposed by Lee
and Fenves (1998) to account for different evolution of strength under tension and compression. The evolution

Nonassociated Flow
Because plastic ﬂow is nonassociated, the use of concrete damaged plasticity results in a nonsymmetric material
stiffness matrix. Therefore, to obtain an acceptable rate of convergence in Abaqus/Standard, the unsymmetric
matrix storage and solution scheme should be used. Abaqus/Standard will automatically activate the unsymmetric
solution scheme if concrete damaged plasticity is used in the analysis. If desired, you can turn off the unsymmetric
solution scheme for a particular step (see Deﬁning an Analysis).
Viscoplastic Regularization
Material models exhibiting softening behavior and stiffness degradation often lead to severe convergence
difﬁculties in implicit analysis programs, such as Abaqus/Standard. A common technique to overcome some of
these convergence difﬁculties is the use of a viscoplastic regularization of the constitutive equations, which
causes the consistent tangent stiffness of the softening material to become positive for sufﬁciently small time
increments.
The concrete damaged plasticity model can be regularized in Abaqus/Standard using viscoplasticity by permitting
stresses to be outside of the yield surface. We use a generalization of the Duvaut-Lions regularization, according
to which the viscoplastic strain rate tensor, 
, is deﬁned as
Here  is the viscosity parameter representing the relaxation time of the viscoplastic system, and 
 is the plastic
strain evaluated in the inviscid backbone model.
Similarly, a viscous stiffness degradation variable, 
, for the viscoplastic system is deﬁned as
451
Abaqus Materials Guide
Concrete Damaged Plasticity

where d is the degradation variable evaluated in the inviscid backbone model. The stress-strain relation of the
viscoplastic model is given as
Using the viscoplastic regularization with a small value for the viscosity parameter (small compared to the
characteristic time increment) usually helps improve the rate of convergence of the model in the softening regime,
without compromising results. The basic idea is that the solution of the viscoplastic system relaxes to that of the
inviscid case as 
, where t represents time. You can specify the value of the viscosity parameter as part
of the concrete damaged plasticity material behavior deﬁnition. If the viscosity parameter is different from zero,
output results of the plastic strain and stiffness degradation refer to the viscoplastic values, 
 and 
. In
Abaqus/Standard the default value of the viscosity parameter is zero, so that no viscoplastic regularization is
performed.
Material Damping
The concrete damaged plasticity model can be used in combination with material damping (see Material Damping).
If stiffness proportional damping is speciﬁed, Abaqus calculates the damping stress based on the undamaged
elastic stiffness. This may introduce large artiﬁcial damping forces on elements undergoing severe damage at
high strain rates.
Visualization of “Crack Directions”
Unlike concrete models based on the smeared crack approach, the concrete damaged plasticity model does not
have the notion of cracks developing at the material integration point. However, it is possible to introduce the
concept of an effective crack direction with the purpose of obtaining a graphical visualization of the cracking
patterns in the concrete structure. Different criteria can be adopted within the framework of scalar-damage
plasticity for the deﬁnition of the direction of cracking. Following Lubliner et. al. (1989), we can assume that
cracking initiates at points where the tensile equivalent plastic strain is greater than zero, 
, and the
maximum principal plastic strain is positive. The direction of the vector normal to the crack plane is assumed
to be parallel to the direction of the maximum principal plastic strain. This direction can be viewed in the

Overview
This feature:
•
is intended for modeling permanent set observed in ﬁlled elastomers and thermoplastics;
•
is based on multiplicative split of the deformation gradient;
•
is based on the theory of incompressible isotropic hardening plasticity;
•
can be used with any isotropic hyperelasticity model;
•
can be combined with Mullins effects; and
•
cannot be used to model viscoelastic or hysteresis effects or with the steady-state transport procedure.
Material Behavior
The real behavior of ﬁlled rubber elastomers under cyclic loading conditions is quite complex as shown in Figure
1.

Permanent Set in Rubberlike Materials

The observed mechanical behaviors are progressive damage resulting in a reduction of load-carrying capacity
with each cycle, stress softening (also known as Mullins effect) upon reloading after the ﬁrst unloading from a
previously attained maximum strain level, hysteretic dissipation of energy, and permanent set. This section is
concerned with modeling permanent set; therefore, the idealized representation of permanent set is described
below.
Idealized Material Behavior
From Figure 1 it is clear that the observed permanent set is different for each cycle, but the material has a tendency
to stabilize after a number of cycles of loading between zero stress and a given level of strain. For a given load
level along the primary loading path shown with the dashed line in Figure 1, the idealized representation of
permanent set will be a single strain value after unloading has taken place. Since rate and time effects are ignored
in this model, idealized loading and unloading take place along the same path, whether Mullins effect is included
or not.
The permanent set behavior is captured by isotropic hardening Mises plasticity with an associated ﬂow rule. In
the context of ﬁnite elastic strains associated with the underlying rubberlike material, plasticity is modeled using
a multiplicative split of the deformation gradient into elastic and plastic components:
where 
 is the elastic part of the deformation gradient (representing the hyperelastic behavior) and 
 is the
plastic part of the deformation gradient (representing the stress-free intermediate conﬁguration).
An example of modeling permanent set along with Mullins effect for a rubberlike material can be found in
Analysis of a solid disc with Mullins effect and permanent set.
Specifying Permanent Set
The primary hyperelastic behavior can be deﬁned by using any of the hyperelastic material models (see
Hyperelastic Behavior of Rubberlike Materials). If test data input is used to deﬁne the hyperelastic response of
the material, the data must be speciﬁed with respect to the stress-free intermediate conﬁguration after unloading
has taken place.
Permanent set can be deﬁned through an isotropic hardening function in terms of the yield stress and the equivalent
plastic strain. In this case the yield stress is the (effective) Kirchoff stress on the primary loading path from which
unloading takes place, and the equivalent plastic strain is the corresponding logarithmic permanent set observed
in the material. If  is the true (Cauchy) stress, Kirchoff stress is deﬁned as 
, where  is the determinant of
.
Depending on what is being modeled, permanent set may be deﬁned as the true permanent set seen in the material
after recovery of viscoelastic strains or it may include viscoelastic strains. In either case, an initial yield stress
is required, below which there will be no permanent set and the behavior of the material will be fully elastic. In
the case of ﬁlled rubbers this initial yield stress may correspond to a small nonzero stress; whereas for the family
of thermoplastic materials, there may be a more marked value of initial yield stress.

Processing Test Data
If you have uniaxial and/or biaxial test data, as shown in Figure 1, you can use the Calibration tool in
Abaqus/CAE to obtain the hyperelasticity, plasticity, and Mullins effect data. For more information about the
Calibration tool, see Creating material calibrations.
Limitations
The model is intended to capture permanent set under multiaxial stress states and mild reverse loading conditions,
as illustrated by Govindarajan, Hurtado, and Mars (2007). This model is not intended to capture deformation
under complete reverse loading. Any rate effects apply only to the plastic part of the material deﬁnition.
Elements
Permanent set can be modeled with all element types that support the use of the hyperelastic material model.
Procedures
Permanent set modeling can be carried out in all procedures that support the use of the hyperelastic material
model with the exception of the steady-state transport procedure. In linear perturbation steps in Abaqus/Standard,
the current material tangent stiffness corresponding to the elastic part is used to determine the response, while
ignoring any plasticity effects.
Output
The standard output identiﬁers available in Abaqus (Abaqus/Standard Output Variable Identiﬁers and
Abaqus/Explicit Output Variable Identiﬁers) corresponding to other isotropic hardening plasticity models can
be obtained for permanent set models.

Overview
The plasticity model for superelastic materials provided in Abaqus is intended for modeling the plastic response of the
martensitic phase of Nitinol-type materials that undergo solid-solid phase transformations and exhibit superelastic-plastic
response.
Material Behavior
The plasticity model for superelastic materials is based on the uniaxial stress-strain response, as shown in Figure
1. Such materials (e.g., Nitinol) are in the austenite phase under no loading conditions. Austenite is assumed to
follow isotropic linear elasticity. On loading the material, the austenite phase starts transforming into martensite
beyond a certain stress. Martensite is assumed to follow an elastoplastic response, with elasticity characterized
by the linear elastic model and the plastic behavior represented by the Drucker-Prager model. Martensite exhibits
plastic behavior after full transformation.

Overview
In Abaqus/Explicit the elastic behavior for bidirectional fabric-reinforced composites is assumed to be in the form of
bilamina elasticity (see Deﬁning Orthotropic Elasticity in Plane Stress with Different Moduli in Tension and
Compression). This shear plasticity model can be used with the ply fabric damage initiation criterion (see Ply Fabric
Criterion) to simulate progressive damage and failure for bidirectional fabric-reinforced composites.
Shear Plasticity Behavior
The shear plasticity model of the matrix is formulated in the local directions of the bidirectional fabric-reinforced
material and is assumed to be decoupled from the response along the local 1 and 2 ﬁber directions. The following
elastic relation gives the in-plane shear stress in terms of the elastic shear strain, 
:
where 
 is the shear modulus of the matrix, 
 is the total shear strain, and 
 is the plastic shear strain.
The yield surface and ﬂow rule are deﬁned as:
where  is the yield stress, 
 is the equivalent plastic strain, and 
 is the equivalent plastic strain rate.
The hardening behavior and strain rate dependency are incorporated into the yield stress  assuming this separable
form:
where 
 is the static yield stress, and  is a ratio, deﬁned as 
 at 
.
The hardening behavior deﬁnes the evolution of the yield surface size, 
, as a function of the equivalent plastic
strain, 
. This evolution can be introduced by specifying 
 directly as a function of 
 in tabular form or by
using the Johnson-Cook law:

Overview
The paperboard plasticity model:
•
consists of the combination of constitutive models for the in-plane, thickness, and out-of-plane shear responses,
which Abaqus assumes to be decoupled;
•
can be used to model the anisotropic in-plane elastic-plastic response;
•
considers the out-of-plane behavior to be linear elastic in tension and elastic-plastic in compression;
•
can be used to model the out-of-plane shear plastic response; and
•
must be used with the orthotropic linear elastic material model (Linear Elastic Behavior) for which the in-plane
and out-of-plane behaviors are decoupled (
 and 
).
Local Directions
Paperboard materials are made with ﬁber and water. During the manufacturing process, most of the ﬁbers are
oriented in the machine direction (MD), and almost no ﬁbers are oriented in the thickness direction (ZD). These
orientations mean that the mechanical response of paperboard material is orthotropic. The two in-plane principal
directions are along the machine (MD) and cross (CD) directions, and the third principal direction is along the
thickness (ZD) direction, as shown in Figure 1.

Progressive Damage and Failure

About Progressive Damage and Failure
Overview
Abaqus provides several models to predict progressive damage and failure.
Progressive damage and failure for ductile metals
Abaqus offers a general capability for modeling progressive damage and failure in ductile metals. The functionality
can be used in conjunction with the Mises, Johnson-Cook, Hill, and Drucker-Prager plasticity models (About
Damage and Failure for Ductile Metals). The capability supports the speciﬁcation of one or more damage
initiation criteria, including ductile, shear, forming limit diagram (FLD), forming limit stress diagram (FLSD),
Müschenborn-Sonne forming limit diagram (MSFLD), and Marciniak-Kuczynski (M-K) criteria. After damage
initiation, the material stiffness is degraded progressively according to the speciﬁed damage evolution response.
The progressive damage models allow for a smooth degradation of the material stiffness, which makes them
suitable for both quasi-static and dynamic situations, a great advantage over the dynamic failure models (Dynamic
Failure Models).
The Johnson-Cook and Marciniak-Kuczynski (M-K) damage initiation criteria are not available in
Abaqus/Standard.
Progressive damage and failure for fiber-reinforced materials
Abaqus offers a capability to model anisotropic damage in ﬁber-reinforced materials, including both unidirectional
ﬁber-reinforced composite materials and bidirectional fabric-reinforced composite materials (About Damage
and Failure for Fiber-Reinforced Composites).
For unidirectional ﬁber-reinforced composite materials, the response of the undamaged material is assumed to
be linearly elastic. The model is intended to predict behavior of ﬁber-reinforced materials for which damage can
be initiated without a large amount of plastic deformation. The capability supports the Hashin and LaRC05
damage initiation criteria to predict the onset of damage. You can specify both criteria for a material. The Hashin
initiation criterion can be used with a damage evolution law that describes the rate of degradation of the material
stiffness once the corresponding initiation criterion is reached. The LaRC05 initiation criterion supports damage
evolution only when used with enriched elements to model discontinuities (such as cracks) in an extended ﬁnite
element method (XFEM) analysis. The LaRC05 initiation criterion is available only in Abaqus/Standard.
For bidirectional fabric-reinforced composite materials, the fabric-reinforced ply is modeled as a homogeneous
orthotropic elastic material with the potential to sustain progressive stiffness degradation due to ﬁber/matrix
cracking. The material response along the ﬁber directions is characterized with damaged elasticity. The model
differentiates between tensile and compressive ﬁber failure modes by activating the corresponding damage
variable depending on the stress state in the ﬁber directions. The in-plane shear response of the matrix is dominated
by the nonlinear behavior of the matrix, which includes both plasticity and stiffness degradation due to matrix
microcracking. The capability uses the ply fabric damage initiation criterion to predict the onset of damage in
combination with a damage evolution law that describes the rate of degradation of the material stiffness once
the corresponding initiation criterion is reached. The ply fabric damage initiation criterion is available only in
Abaqus/Explicit.

About Progressive Damage and Failure

Progressive damage and failure for fabric-reinforced materials
Abaqus offers a capability to model anisotropic damage in fabric-reinforced composites. The fabric-reinforced
ply is modeled as a homogeneous orthotropic elastic material with the potential to sustain progressive stiffness
degradation due to ﬁber/matrix cracking and rate-dependent plastic deformation under shear loading. The material
response along the ﬁber directions is characterized with damaged elasticity, and the model differentiates between
tensile and compressive ﬁber failure modes by activating the corresponding damage variable depending on the
stress state in the ﬁber directions. The shear response is dominated by the nonlinear behavior of the matrix,
which includes both plasticity and stiffness degradation due to matrix microcracking. The capability supports
the ply fabric damage initiation criterion to predict the onset of damage with a damage evolution law that describes
the rate of degradation of the material stiffness once the corresponding initiation criterion is reached.
Progressive damage and failure for ductile materials in low-cycle fatigue analysis
Abaqus/Standard offers a capability to model progressive damage and failure for ductile materials due to stress
reversals and the accumulation of inelastic strain in a low-cycle fatigue analysis using the direct cyclic approach
(see Low-Cycle Fatigue Analysis Using the Direct Cyclic Approach). The damage initiation criterion and damage
evolution are characterized by the accumulated inelastic hysteresis energy per stabilized cycle (see About Damage
and Failure for Ductile Materials in Low-Cycle Fatigue Analysis). After damage initiation, the elastic material
stiffness is degraded progressively according to the speciﬁed damage evolution response.
In addition, Abaqus offers a concrete damaged model (Concrete Damaged Plasticity), dynamic failure models (Dynamic
Failure Models), and specialized capabilities for modeling damage and failure in cohesive elements (Deﬁning the
Constitutive Response of Cohesive Elements Using a Traction-Separation Description) and in connectors (Connector
Damage Behavior).
This section provides an overview of the progressive damage and failure capability and a brief description of the
concepts of damage initiation and evolution. The discussion in this section is limited to damage models for ductile
metals and ﬁber-reinforced materials.

General Framework for Modeling Damage and Failure
Abaqus offers a general framework for material failure modeling that allows the combination of multiple failure
mechanisms acting simultaneously on the same material. Material failure refers to the complete loss of
load-carrying capacity that results from progressive degradation of the material stiffness. The stiffness degradation
process is modeled using damage mechanics.
To help understand the failure modeling capabilities in Abaqus, consider the response of a typical metal specimen
during a uniaxial tensile test. Figure 1(a), shows the nominal (or engineering) stress-strain response measured
directly in a tensile test. The nominal stress reaches a maximum (ultimate tensile strength) value at point ,
corresponding to the onset of incipient necking. Beyond this point, deformation localizes in a neck region and
the stress-strain state is not uniform in the specimen. Therefore, after point , the curve is no longer representative
of the actual stress-strain state at any given location of the specimen. At point , there is a marked reduction of
load-carrying capacity until rupture occurs, 
. Due to the nonhomogeneous deformation in the specimen,
the nominal stress-strain curve cannot be used directly to characterize the material model. Instead, Abaqus
requires the material model to be deﬁned in terms of the true stress-strain response.
Figure 1(b) shows the true stress-strain response at the critical location of the specimen where failure occurs.
The labels , , , , and  on this curve indicate the local true stress-strain states of the material corresponding
to each stage of the nominal stress-strain curve (Figure 1(a)). The material response is initially linear elastic,

strain-hardening portion of the true stress-strain curve. Beyond point , there is a marked reduction of load-carrying
capacity until rupture, 
. Point  in this curve identiﬁes the material state at the onset of damage, which is
referred to as the damage initiation criterion. Beyond this point, the true stress-strain response 
 is governed
by the evolution of the degradation of the stiffness leading to complete failure. In the context of damage mechanics,
 can be viewed as the degraded response of the curve 
 that the material would have followed in the
absence of damage.

response and (b) true-stress strain response at the critical location of failure.
Thus, in Abaqus, you must specify a failure mechanism in terms of the true stress-strain response, consisting of
four distinct parts:
•
The deﬁnition of the effective (or undamaged) material response (for example, 
 in Figure
1(b))
•
A damage initiation criterion (for example,  in Figure 1(b))
•
A damage evolution law (for example, 
 in Figure 1(b))
•
A choice of element deletion where elements can be removed from the calculations once the material stiffness
is fully degraded (for example,  in Figure 1(b))
These parts are discussed separately for ductile metals (About Damage and Failure for Ductile Metals) and
ﬁber-reinforced materials (About Damage and Failure for Fiber-Reinforced Composites).
Mesh Dependency
In continuum mechanics the constitutive model is normally expressed in terms of stress-strain relations. When
the material exhibits strain-softening behavior, leading to strain localization, this formulation results in a strong
mesh dependency of the ﬁnite element results in that the energy dissipated decreases on mesh reﬁnement. In
Abaqus all of the available damage evolution models use a formulation intended to alleviate the mesh dependency.
This is accomplished by introducing a characteristic length into the formulation, which in Abaqus is related to
the element size, and expressing the softening part of the constitutive law as a stress-displacement relation. In
this case the energy dissipated during the damage process is speciﬁed per unit area, not per unit volume. This
energy is treated as an additional material parameter, and it is used to compute the displacement at which full
material damage occurs. This is consistent with the concept of critical energy release rate as a material parameter
for fracture mechanics. This formulation ensures that the correct amount of energy is dissipated and greatly
alleviates the mesh dependency.

Overview
Abaqus/Standard and Abaqus/Explicit offer a general capability for predicting the onset of failure and a capability for
modeling progressive damage and failure of ductile metals. In the most general case this requires the speciﬁcation of
the following:
•
the undamaged elastic-plastic response of the material (Classical Metal Plasticity);
•
a damage initiation criterion (Damage Initiation for Ductile Metals); and
•
a damage evolution response, including a choice of element removal (Damage Evolution and Element Removal
for Ductile Metals).
A summary of the general framework for progressive damage and failure in Abaqus is given in About Progressive
Damage and Failure. This section provides an overview of the damage initiation criteria and damage evolution law
for ductile metals. In addition, Abaqus/Explicit offers dynamic failure models that are suitable for high-strain-rate
dynamic problems (Dynamic Failure Models).
Damage Initiation Criterion
Abaqus offers a variety of choices of damage initiation criteria for ductile metals, each associated with distinct
types of material failure. They can be classiﬁed in the following categories:
•
Damage initiation criteria for the fracture of metals, including ductile (tabular, Johnson-Cook, and
Hosford-Coulomb) and shear.
•
Damage initiation criteria for the necking instability of sheet metal. These include forming limit diagrams
(FLD, FLSD, and MSFLD) intended to assess the formability of sheet metal and the Marciniak-Kuczynski
(M-K) criterion (available only in Abaqus/Explicit) to numerically predict necking instability in sheet metal
taking into account the deformation history.
These criteria are discussed in Damage Initiation for Ductile Metals. Each damage initiation criterion has an
associated output variable to indicate whether the criterion has been met during the analysis. A value of 1.0 or
higher indicates that the initiation criterion has been met.
More than one damage initiation criterion can be speciﬁed for a given material. If multiple damage initiation
criteria are speciﬁed for the same material, they are treated independently. Once a particular initiation criterion
is satisﬁed, the material stiffness is degraded according to the speciﬁed damage evolution law for that criterion;
in the absence of a damage evolution law, however, the material stiffness is not degraded. A failure mechanism
for which no damage evolution response is speciﬁed is said to be inactive. Abaqus will evaluate the initiation

Damage Evolution
The damage evolution law describes the rate of degradation of the material stiffness once the corresponding
initiation criterion has been reached. For damage in ductile metals Abaqus assumes that the degradation of the
stiffness associated with each active failure mechanism can be modeled using a scalar damage variable, 
(
), where 
 represents the set of active mechanisms. At any given time during the analysis the stress
tensor in the material is given by the scalar damage equation
where D is the overall damage variable and  is the effective (or undamaged) stress tensor computed in the
current increment.  are the stresses that would exist in the material in the absence of damage. The material has
lost its load-carrying capacity when 
. By default, an element is removed from the mesh on material failure.
The overall damage variable, D, captures the combined effect of all active mechanisms and is computed in terms
of the individual damage variables, 
, according to a user-speciﬁed rule.
Abaqus supports different models of damage evolution in ductile metals and provides controls associated with
element deletion due to material failure, as described in Damage Evolution and Element Removal for Ductile
Metals. All of the available models use a formulation intended to alleviate the strong mesh dependency of the
results that can arise from strain localization effects during progressive damage.

Elements
The failure modeling capability for ductile metals can be used with any elements in Abaqus that include mechanical
behavior (elements that have displacement degrees of freedom).
For coupled temperature-displacement elements the thermal properties of the material are not affected by the
progressive damage of the material stiffness until the condition for element deletion is reached; at this point the
thermal contribution of the element is also removed.
The damage initiation criteria for sheet metal necking instability (FLD, FLSD, MSFLD, and M-K) are available
only for elements that include mechanical behavior and use a plane stress formulation (that is, plane stress, shell,
continuum shell, and membrane elements).

Damage Initiation Criteria for Fracture of Metals
Two main mechanisms can cause the fracture of a ductile metal: ductile fracture due to the nucleation, growth,
and coalescence of voids; and shear fracture due to shear band localization. Based on phenomenological
observations, these two mechanisms call for different forms of the criteria for the onset of damage (Hooputra
et al., 2004). The functional forms provided by Abaqus for these criteria are discussed below. These criteria can
be used in combination with the damage evolution models for ductile metals discussed in Damage Evolution
and Element Removal for Ductile Metals to model fracture of a ductile metal. (See Progressive failure analysis
of thin-wall aluminum extrusion under quasi-static and dynamic loads for an example.)
Ductile Criterion
The ductile criterion is a phenomenological model for predicting the onset of damage due to nucleation, growth,
and coalescence of voids. The model assumes that the equivalent plastic strain at the onset of damage, 
, is a
function of stress triaxiality and strain rate:
477

where 
 is the stress triaxiality, p is the pressure stress, q is the Mises equivalent stress, and 
 is the
equivalent plastic strain rate. The criterion for damage initiation is met when the following condition is satisﬁed:
where 
 is a state variable that increases monotonically with plastic deformation. At each increment during
the analysis the incremental increase in 
 is computed as

Defining Dependency of Ductile Criterion on Lode Angle
Experimental results for aluminum alloys and other metals (Bai and Wierzbicki, 2008) reveal that, in addition
to stress triaxiality and strain rate, ductile fracture can also depend on the third invariant of deviatoric stress,
which is related to the Lode angle (or deviatoric polar angle). Speciﬁc models that account for this dependency
include the Modiﬁed Mohr-Coulomb (MMC) fracture criterion proposed by Bai and Wierzbicki (2010) and the
Hosford-Coulomb criterion proposed by Mohr and Marcadet (2015). Abaqus allows the deﬁnition of the
equivalent plastic strain at the onset of ductile damage, 
, as a function of the Lode angle, , by way of the
functional form
where the lode angle term, 
, is deﬁned as
q is the Mises equivalent stress, and r is the third invariant of deviatoric stress, 
. The lode
angle term 
 can take values from

states on the tensile meridian.

The Johnson-Cook criterion can be used in conjunction with the Mises, Johnson-Cook, Hill, and Drucker-Prager
plasticity models, including equation of state. When used in conjunction with the Johnson-Cook plasticity model,
the speciﬁed values of the melting and transition temperatures should be consistent with the values speciﬁed in
the plasticity deﬁnition. The Johnson-Cook damage initiation criterion can also be speciﬁed together with any
other initiation criteria, including the ductile criteria; each initiation criterion is treated independently.

Shear Criterion
The shear criterion is a phenomenological model for predicting the onset of damage due to shear band localization.

ratio and strain rate:
Here 
 is the shear stress ratio, 
 is the maximum shear stress, and

parameter. A typical value of

initiation is met when the following condition is satisﬁed:

change in equivalent plastic strain. At each increment during the analysis, the incremental increase in

Nonlinear Accumulation of the Damage Initiation Criterion
The linear form of accumulation of the damage initiation criterion described above might not predict the correct
onset of damage in situations when the deformation history is not linear (for example, changing stress triaxiality).
It has been shown that you can achieve better predictions if you use a formulation based on a power law rule to
characterize the nonlinearity in the accumulation of the damage initiation criterion. This power law formulation
is available with the ductile, shear, and Hosford-Coulomb criteria in both Abaqus/Standard and Abaqus/Explicit
and with the Johnson-Cook criterion in Abaqus/Explicit. For the ductile and Johnson-Cook criteria, it has the

Damage Initiation Criteria for Sheet Metal Instability
Necking instability plays a determining factor in sheet metal forming processes: the size of the local neck region
is typically of the order of the thickness of the sheet, and local necks can rapidly lead to fracture. Localized
necking cannot be modeled with traditional shell elements used in sheet metal forming simulations because the
size of the neck is of the order of the thickness of the element. Abaqus supports four criteria for predicting the
onset of necking instability in sheet metals: forming limit diagram (FLD); forming limit stress diagram (FLSD);
Müschenborn-Sonne forming limit diagram (MSFLD); and Marciniak-Kuczynski (M-K) criteria, which is
available only in Abaqus/Explicit. These criteria apply only to elements with a plane stress formulation (plane
stress, shell, continuum shell, and membrane elements); Abaqus ignores these criteria for other elements. The
initiation criteria for necking instability can be used in combination with the damage evolution models discussed
in Damage Evolution and Element Removal for Ductile Metals to account for the damage induced by necking.
Classical strain-based forming limit diagrams (FLDs) are known to be dependent on the strain path. Changes in
the deformation mode (for example, equibiaxial loading followed by uniaxial tensile strain) may result in major
modiﬁcations in the level of the limit strains. Therefore, the FLD damage initiation criterion should be used with
care if the strain paths in the analysis are nonlinear. In practical industrial applications, signiﬁcant changes in
the strain path may be induced by multistep forming operations, complex geometry of the tooling, and interface
friction, among other factors. For problems with highly nonlinear strain paths Abaqus offers three additional
damage initiation criteria: the forming limit stress diagram (FLSD) criterion, the Müschenborn-Sonne forming
limit diagram (MSFLD) criterion, and in Abaqus/Explicit the Marciniak-Kuczynski (M-K) criterion; these
alternatives to the FLD damage initiation criterion are intended to minimize load path dependence.
The characteristics of each criterion available in Abaqus for predicting damage initiation in sheet metals are
discussed below.
Forming Limit Diagram (FLD) Criterion
The forming limit diagram (FLD) is a useful concept introduced by Keeler and Backofen (1964) to determine
the amount of deformation that a material can withstand prior to the onset of necking instability. The maximum
Abaqus Materials Guide
482
Damage Initiation for Ductile Metals

strains that a sheet material can sustain prior to the onset of necking are referred to as the forming limit strains.
A FLD is a plot of the forming limit strains in the space of principal (in-plane) logarithmic strains. In the discussion
that follows major and minor limit strains refer to the maximum and minimum values of the in-plane principal
limit strains, respectively. The major limit strain is usually represented on the vertical axis and the minor strain
on the horizontal axis, as illustrated in Figure 1. The line connecting the states at which deformation becomes
unstable is referred to as the forming limit curve (FLC). The FLC gives a sense of the formability of a sheet of
material. Strains computed numerically by Abaqus can be compared to a FLC to determine the feasibility of the
forming process under analysis.

The FLD damage initiation criterion requires the speciﬁcation of the FLC in tabular form by giving the major
principal strain at damage initiation as a tabular function of the minor principal strain and, optionally, temperature
and predeﬁned ﬁeld variables, 
. The damage initiation criterion for the FLD is given by the
condition 
, where the variable 
 is a function of the current deformation state and is deﬁned as the
ratio of the current major principal strain, 
, to the major limit strain on the FLC evaluated at the current
values of the minor principal strain, 
; temperature, ; and predeﬁned ﬁeld variables, 
:
For example, for the deformation state given by point A in Figure 1 the damage initiation criterion is evaluated
as 
If the value of the minor strain lies outside the range of the speciﬁed tabular values, Abaqus will extrapolate the
value of the major limit strain on the FLC by assuming that the slope at the endpoint of the curve remains constant.
Extrapolation with respect to temperature and ﬁeld variables follows the standard conventions: the property is
assumed to be constant outside the speciﬁed range of temperature and ﬁeld variables (see Material Data
Deﬁnition).
Experimentally, FLDs are measured under conditions of biaxial stretching of a sheet, without bending effects.
Under bending loading, however, most materials can achieve limit strains that are much greater than those on
the FLC. To avoid the prediction of early failure under bending deformation, Abaqus evaluates the FLD criterion
using the strains at the midplane through the thickness of the element. For composite shells with several layers
the criterion is evaluated at the midplane of each layer for which a FLD curve has been speciﬁed, which ensures
that only biaxial stretching effects are taken into account. Therefore, the FLD criterion is not suitable for modeling
failure under bending loading; other failure models (such as ductile and shear failure) are more appropriate for
such loading. Once the FLD damage initiation criterion is met, the evolution of damage is driven independently
at each material point through the thickness of the element based on the local deformation at that point. Thus,
although bending effects do not affect the evaluation of the FLD criterion, they may affect the rate of evolution
of damage.

Forming Limit Stress Diagram (FLSD) Criterion
When strain-based FLCs are converted into stress-based FLCs, the resulting stress-based curves have been shown
to be minimally affected by changes to the strain path (Stoughton, 2000); that is, different strain-based FLCs,
corresponding to different strain paths, are mapped onto a single stress-based FLC. This property makes forming
limit stress diagrams (FLSDs) an attractive alternative to FLDs for the prediction of necking instability under
arbitrary loading. However, the apparent independence of the stress-based limit curves on the strain path may
simply reﬂect the small sensitivity of the yield stress to changes in plastic deformation. This topic is still under
discussion in the research community.
A FLSD is the stress counterpart of the FLD, with the major and minor principal in-plane stresses corresponding
to the onset of necking localization plotted on the vertical and horizontal axes, respectively. In Abaqus the FLSD
damage initiation criterion requires the speciﬁcation of the major principal in-plane stress at damage initiation
as a tabular function of the minor principal in-plane stress and, optionally, temperature and predeﬁned ﬁeld
variables, 
. The damage initiation criterion for the FLSD is met when the condition 
is satisﬁed, where the variable 
 is a function of the current stress state and is deﬁned as the ratio of the
current major principal stress, 
, to the major stress on the FLSD evaluated at the current values of minor
stress, 
; temperature, ; and predeﬁned ﬁeld variables, 
:
If the value of the minor stress lies outside the range of speciﬁed tabular values, Abaqus will extrapolate the
value of the major limit stress assuming that the slope at the endpoints of the curve remains constant. Extrapolation
with respect to temperature and ﬁeld variables follows the standard conventions: the property is assumed to be
constant outside the speciﬁed range of temperature and ﬁeld variables (see Material Data Deﬁnition).
For reasons similar to those discussed earlier for the FLD criterion, Abaqus evaluates the FLSD criterion using
the stresses averaged through the thickness of the element (or the layer, in the case of composite shells with
several layers), ignoring bending effects. Therefore, the FLSD criterion cannot be used to model failure under
bending loading; other failure models (such as ductile and shear failure) are more suitable for such loading. Once
the FLSD damage initiation criterion is met, the evolution of damage is driven independently at each material
point through the thickness of the element based on the local deformation at that point. Thus, although bending
effects do not affect the evaluation of the FLSD criterion, they may affect the rate of evolution of damage.

Marciniak-Kuczynski (M-K) Criterion
Another approach available in Abaqus/Explicit for accurately predicting the forming limits for arbitrary loading
paths is based on the localization analysis proposed by Marciniak and Kuczynski (1967). The approach can be
used with the Mises and Johnson-Cook plasticity models, including kinematic hardening. In M-K analysis, virtual
thickness imperfections are introduced as grooves simulating preexisting defects in an otherwise uniform sheet
material. The deformation ﬁeld is computed inside each groove as a result of the applied loading outside the
groove. Necking is considered to occur when the ratio of the deformation in the groove relative to the nominal
deformation (outside the groove) is greater than a critical value.
Figure 2 shows schematically the geometry of the groove considered for M-K analysis. In the ﬁgure a denotes
the nominal region in the shell element outside the imperfection, and b denotes the weak groove region. The
initial thickness of the imperfection relative to the nominal thickness is given by the ratio 
, with the
subscript 0 denoting quantities in the initial, strain-free state. The groove is oriented at a zero angle with respect
to the 1-direction of the local material orientation.

Abaqus/Explicit allows the speciﬁcation of an anisotropic distribution of thickness imperfections as a function
of angle with respect to the local material orientation, 
. Abaqus/Explicit ﬁrst solves for the stress-strain
ﬁeld in the nominal area ignoring the presence of imperfections; then it considers the effect of each groove alone.
The deformation ﬁeld inside each groove is computed by enforcing the strain compatibility condition
and the force equilibrium equations
The subscripts n and t refer to the directions normal and tangential to the groove. In the above equilibrium
equations 
 and 
 are forces per unit width in the t-direction.
The onset of necking instability is assumed to occur when the ratio of the rate of deformation inside a groove
relative to the rate of deformation if no groove were present is greater than a critical value. In addition, it may
not be possible to ﬁnd a solution that satisﬁes equilibrium and compatibility conditions once localization initiates
at a particular groove; consequently, failure to ﬁnd a converged solution is also an indicator of the onset of
localized necking. For the evaluation of the damage initiation criterion Abaqus/Explicit uses the following
measures of deformation severity:
485
Abaqus Materials Guide
Damage Initiation for Ductile Metals

These deformation severity factors are evaluated on each of the speciﬁed groove directions and compared with
the critical values. (The evaluation is performed only if the incremental deformation is primarily plastic; the
M-K criterion will not predict damage initiation if the deformation increment is elastic.) The most unfavorable
groove direction is used for the evaluation of the damage initiation criterion, which is given as
where 
, 
, and 
 are the critical values of the deformation severity indices. Damage initiation occurs
when 
 or when a converged solution to the equilibrium and compatibility equations cannot be found.
By default, Abaqus/Explicit assumes 
; you can specify different values. If one of these
parameters is set equal to zero, its corresponding deformation severity factor is not included in the evaluation
of the damage initiation criterion. If all of these parameters are set equal to zero, the M-K criterion is based solely
on nonconvergence of the equilibrium and compatibility equations.
You must specify the fraction, 
, equal to the initial thickness at the virtual imperfection divided by the nominal
thickness (see Figure 2), as well as the number of imperfections to be used for the evaluation of the M-K damage
initiation criterion. It is assumed that these directions are equally spaced angularly. By default, Abaqus/Explicit
uses four imperfections located at 0°, 45°, 90°, and 135° with respect to the local 1-direction of the material.
The initial imperfection size can be deﬁned as a tabular function of angular direction, 
; this allows the
modeling of an anisotropic distribution of ﬂaws in the material. Abaqus/Explicit will use this table to evaluate
the thickness of each of the imperfections that will be used for the evaluation of the M-K analysis method. In
addition, the initial imperfection size can also be a function of initial temperature and ﬁeld variables; this allows
deﬁning a nonuniform spatial distribution of imperfections. Abaqus/Explicit will compute the initial imperfection
size based on the values of temperature and ﬁeld variables at the beginning of the analysis. The initial size of
the imperfection remains a constant property during the rest of the analysis.
A general recommendation is to choose the value of 
 such that the forming limit predicted numerically for
uniaxial strain loading conditions (
) matches the experimental result.
The virtual grooves are introduced to evaluate the onset of necking instability; they do not inﬂuence the results
in the underlying element. Once the criterion for necking instability is met, the material properties in the element
are degraded according to the speciﬁed damage evolution law.

Performance Considerations for the M-K Criterion
There can be a substantial increase in the overall computational cost when the M-K criterion is used. For example,
the cost of processing a shell element with three section points through the thickness and four imperfections,
which is the default for the M-K criterion, increases by approximately a factor of two compared to the cost
without the M-K criterion. You can mitigate the cost of evaluating this damage initiation criterion by reducing
the number of ﬂaw directions considered or by increasing the number of increments between M-K computations,
as explained below. Of course, the effect on the overall analysis cost depends on the fraction of the elements in
the model that use this damage initiation criterion. The computational cost per element with the M-K criterion
increases by approximately a factor of

may vary from this estimate. By default, Abaqus/Explicit performs the M-K computations on each imperfection

Müschenborn-Sonne Forming Limit Diagram (MSFLD) Criterion
Müschenborn and Sonne (1975) proposed a method to predict the inﬂuence of the deformation path on the
forming limits of sheet metals on the basis of the equivalent plastic strain, by assuming that the forming limit
curve represents the sum of the highest attainable equivalent plastic strains. Abaqus makes use of a generalization
of this idea to establish a criterion of necking instability of sheet metals for arbitrary deformation paths. The
approach requires transforming the original forming limit curve (without predeformation effects) from the space
of major versus minor strains to the space of equivalent plastic strain, 
, versus ratio of principal strain rates,

According to the MSFLD criterion, the onset of localized necking occurs when the sequence of deformation
states in the 
–  diagram intersects the forming limit curve, as discussed below. It is emphasized that for linear
deformation paths both FLD and MSFLD representations are identical and give rise to the same predictions. For
arbitrary loading, however, the MSFLD representation takes into account the effects of the history of deformation
through the use of the accumulated equivalent plastic strain.
For the speciﬁcation of the MSFLD damage initiation criterion in Abaqus, you can directly provide the equivalent
plastic strain at damage initiation as a tabular function of  and, optionally, equivalent plastic strain rate,
temperature, and predeﬁned ﬁeld variables, 
. Alternatively, you can specify the curve in
the traditional FLD format (in the space of major and minor strains) by providing a tabular function of the form

The MSFLD criterion for necking instability is met when the condition

instability also occurs if the sequence of deformation states in the

to a sudden change in the straining direction. This situation is illustrated in Figure 4. As  changes from

The equivalent plastic strain 
 used for the evaluation of the MSFLD criterion in Abaqus is accumulated only
over increments that result in an increase of the element area. Strain increments associated with a reduction of
the element area cannot cause necking and do not contribute toward the evaluation of the MSFLD criterion.
If the value of  lies outside the range of speciﬁed tabular values, Abaqus extrapolates the value of equivalent
plastic strain for initiation of necking assuming that the slope at the endpoints of the curve remains constant.
Extrapolation with respect to strain rate, temperature, and ﬁeld variables follows the standard conventions: the
property is assumed to be constant outside the speciﬁed range of strain rate, temperature, and ﬁeld variables (see
Material Data Deﬁnition).
As discussed in Progressive damage and failure of ductile metals, predictions of necking instability based on
the MSFLD criterion agree remarkably well with predictions based on the Marciniak and Kuczynski criterion,
at signiﬁcantly less computational cost than the Marciniak and Kuczynski criterion. There are some situations,
however, in which the MSFLD criterion may overpredict the amount of formability left in the material. This
occurs in situations when, sometime during the loading history, the material reaches a state that is very close to
the point of necking instability and is subsequently strained in a direction along which it can sustain further
deformation. In this case the MSFLD criterion may predict that the amount of additional formability in the new
direction is greater than that predicted with the Marciniak and Kuczynski criterion. However, this situation is
often not a concern in practical forming applications where safety factors in the forming limit diagrams are
commonly used to ensure that the material state is sufﬁciently far away from the point of necking. Refer to
Progressive damage and failure of ductile metals for a comparative analysis of these two criteria.
For reasons similar to those discussed earlier for the FLD criterion, Abaqus evaluates the MSFLD criterion using
the strains at the midplane through the thickness of the element (or the layer, in the case of composite shells with
several layers), ignoring bending effects. Therefore, the MSFLD criterion cannot be used to model failure under
bending loading; other failure models (such as ductile and shear failure) are more suitable for such loading. Once
the MSFLD damage initiation criterion is met, the evolution of damage is driven independently at each material
point through the thickness of the element based on the local deformation at that point. Thus, although bending
effects do not affect the evaluation of the MSFLD criterion, they may affect the rate of evolution of damage.

Numerical Evaluation of the Principal Strain Rates Ratio
The ratio of principal strain rates, 
, can jump in value due to sudden changes in the deformation
path. Special care is required during explicit dynamic simulations to avoid nonphysical jumps in  triggered by
numerical noise, which may cause a horizontal intersection of the deformation state with the forming limit curve
and lead to the premature prediction of necking instability.
To overcome this problem, rather than computing  as a ratio of instantaneous strain rates, Abaqus/Explicit
periodically updates  based on accumulated strain increments after small but signiﬁcant changes in the equivalent
plastic strain. The threshold value for the change in equivalent plastic strain triggering an update of  is denoted
as 
, and  is approximated as
where 
 and 
 are principal values of the accumulated plastic strain since the previous update
of . The default value of 
 is 0.002 (0.2%).
In addition, Abaqus/Explicit supports the following ﬁltering method for the computation of :
where 
 represents the accumulated time over the analysis increments required to have an increase in
equivalent plastic strain of at least 
. The factor  (
) facilitates ﬁltering high-frequency
oscillations. This ﬁltering method is usually not necessary provided that an appropriate value of 
 is used.
You can specify the value of  directly. The default value is

Hardening).
In addition, when the initial equivalent plastic strain is greater than the minimum value on the forming limit
curve, the initial value of  plays an important role in determining whether the MSFLD damage initiation criterion
will be met during subsequent deformation. It is, therefore, important to specify the initial value of  in these
situations. To this end, you can specify initial values of the plastic strain tensor (see Deﬁning Initial Values of
Plastic Strain). Abaqus will use this information to compute the initial value of  as the ratio of the minor and
major principal plastic strains; that is, neglecting the elastic component of deformation and assuming a linear
deformation path.

if no damage evolution is speciﬁed, the criterion for damage initiation will continue to be computed beyond the
point of damage initiation; in this case the output variable can take values greater than 1, indicating by how much
the initiation criterion has been exceeded.

Overview
The damage evolution capability for ductile metals:
•
assumes that damage is characterized by the progressive degradation of the material stiffness, leading to material
failure;
•
must be used in combination with a damage initiation criterion for ductile metals (Damage Initiation for Ductile
Metals);
•
uses mesh-independent measures (either plastic displacement or physical energy dissipation) to drive the evolution
of damage after damage initiation;
•
takes into account the combined effect of different damage mechanisms acting simultaneously on the same material
and includes options to specify how each mechanism contributes to the overall material degradation; and
•
offers options for what occurs upon failure, including the removal of elements from the mesh.
Damage Evolution
Figure 1 illustrates the characteristic true stress-strain behavior of a material undergoing damage. (As discussed
in General Framework for Modeling Damage and Failure, this curve should not be confused with the nominal
stress-strain response measured in a uniaxial test.) In the context of an elastic-plastic material with isotropic
hardening, the damage manifests itself in two forms: softening of the yield stress and degradation of the elasticity.
The solid curve in the ﬁgure represents the damaged stress-strain response, while the dashed curve is the response
in the absence of damage. As discussed later, the damaged response depends on the element dimensions such
that mesh dependency of the results is minimized.

equivalent plastic strain at failure; that is, when the overall damage variable reaches the value 
. The overall
damage variable, D, captures the combined effect of all active damage mechanisms and is computed in terms
of the individual damage variables, 
, as discussed later in this section (see Evaluating Overall Damage When
Multiple Criteria Are Active).
The value of the equivalent plastic strain at failure, 
, depends on the characteristic length of the element and
cannot be used as a material parameter for the speciﬁcation of the damage evolution law. Instead, the damage
evolution law is speciﬁed in terms of equivalent plastic displacement, 
, or in terms of fracture energy
dissipation, 
; these concepts are deﬁned next.
Mesh Dependency and Characteristic Length
When material damage occurs, the stress-strain relationship no longer accurately represents the material's behavior.
Continuing to use the stress-strain relation introduces a strong mesh dependency based on strain localization,
such that the energy dissipated decreases as the mesh is reﬁned. A different approach is required to follow the
strain-softening branch of the stress-strain response curve. Hillerborg's (1976) fracture energy proposal is used
to reduce mesh dependency by creating a stress-displacement response after damage is initiated. Using brittle
fracture concepts, Hillerborg deﬁnes the energy required to open a unit area of crack, 
, as a material parameter.
With this approach, the softening response after damage initiation is characterized by a stress-displacement
response rather than a stress-strain response.
The implementation of this stress-displacement concept in a ﬁnite element model requires the deﬁnition of a
characteristic length, L, associated with an integration point. The fracture energy is then given as
This expression introduces the deﬁnition of the equivalent plastic displacement, 
, as the fracture work conjugate
of the yield stress after the onset of damage (work per unit area of the crack). Before damage initiation 
;
after damage initiation 
.
The deﬁnition of the characteristic length depends on the element geometry and formulation: it is a typical length
of a line across an element for a ﬁrst-order element; it is half of the same typical length for a second-order
Abaqus Materials Guide

Damage Evolution and Element Removal for Ductile Metals

element. For beams and trusses it is a characteristic length along the element axis. For membranes and shells it
is a characteristic length in the reference surface. For axisymmetric elements it is a characteristic length in the
r–z plane only. For cohesive elements it is equal to the constitutive thickness. This deﬁnition of the characteristic
length is used because the direction in which fracture occurs is not known in advance. Therefore, elements with
large aspect ratios will have rather different behavior depending on the direction in which they crack: some mesh
sensitivity remains because of this effect, and elements that have aspect ratios close to unity are recommended.
Alternatively, this mesh dependency could be reduced by directly specifying the characteristic length as a function
of the element topology and material orientation in user subroutine VUCHARLENGTH (see Deﬁning the
Characteristic Element Length at a Material Point in Abaqus/Explicit).
Each damage initiation criterion described in Damage Initiation for Ductile Metals might have an associated
damage evolution law. The damage evolution law can be speciﬁed in terms of equivalent plastic displacement,
, or in terms of fracture energy dissipation, 
. Both of these options take into account the characteristic
length of the element to alleviate mesh dependency of the results.
Evaluating Overall Damage When Multiple Criteria Are Active
The overall damage variable, D, captures the combined effect of all active mechanisms and is computed in terms
of individual damage variables, 
, for each mechanism. You can choose to combine some of the damage variables
in a multiplicative sense to form an intermediate variable, 
, as follows:
Then, the overall damage variable is computed as the maximum of 
 and the remaining damage variables:
In the above expressions 
 and 
 represent the sets of active mechanisms that contribute to the overall
damage in a multiplicative and a maximum sense, respectively, with 
.

criterion contributes to the overall damage variable in a maximum sense (default):

Defining Damage Evolution Based on Effective Plastic Displacement
As discussed previously, once the damage initiation criterion has been reached, the effective plastic displacement,
, is deﬁned with the evolution equation
where L is the characteristic length of the element.
The evolution of the damage variable with the relative plastic displacement can be speciﬁed in tabular, linear,
or exponential form. Instantaneous failure occurs if the plastic displacement at failure, 
, is speciﬁed as 0;
however, this choice is not recommended and should be used with care because it causes a sudden drop of the
stress at the material point that can lead to dynamic instabilities.
Tabular Form
You can specify the damage variable directly as a tabular function of equivalent plastic displacement, 
,
as shown in Figure 2(a).

Maximum Degradation and Choice of Element Removal
You have control over how Abaqus treats elements with severe damage. You can specify an upper bound, 
,
to the overall damage variable, 
 and you can choose whether to delete an element once maximum degradation
is reached. The latter choice also affects which stiffness components are damaged.
Specifying the Value of Maximum Degradation
The default setting of 
 depends on whether elements are to be deleted upon material failure. For the default
case of element deletion and in all cases for cohesive elements, 
; otherwise,

variable SDEG contains the value of 
 No further damage is accumulated at an integration point once  reaches

Use the following option to specify

Input File Usage:
*SECTION CONTROLS, MAX DEGRADATION=
Removing the Element from the Mesh
A material point is assumed to fail upon reaching maximum degradation. Except for cohesive elements with
traction-separation response (see Deﬁning the Constitutive Response of Cohesive Elements Using a
Traction-Separation Description), Abaqus applies damage to all stiffness components equally at material points
during the progressive damage process. At any given time during the analysis, the stress tensor in the material
is given by the scalar damage equation
where  is the effective (or undamaged) stress tensor computed in the current increment. By default, an element
is deleted (or removed) from a mesh upon material failure. Details for element deletion driven by material failure
are described in Material Failure and Element Deletion. The status of a material point and an element can be
determined by requesting output variables STATUSMP and STATUS, respectively.
In a heat transfer analysis the thermal properties of the material are not affected by the damage status of the
material stiffness until the element deletion condition is reached; at this point, the thermal contribution of the
element is also removed.
Use the following option to delete the element from the mesh (default):
Input File Usage:
*SECTION CONTROLS, ELEMENT DELETION=YES
Keeping the Element in the Computations
Optionally, you can choose not to remove the element from the mesh, except in the case of three-dimensional
beam elements. With element deletion turned off, the overall damage variable is enforced to be 
. The
default value is 
 if element deletion is turned off, which ensures that elements remain active in the
simulation with a residual stiffness of at least 1% of the original stiffness. The dimensionality of the stress state
of the element affects which stiffness components can become damaged, as discussed below.
In a heat transfer analysis the thermal properties of the material are not affected by damage of the material
stiffness.

Elements with Three-Dimensional Stress States in Abaqus/Explicit
For elements with three-dimensional stress states (including generalized plane strain elements), the shear stiffness
will be degraded up to a maximum value, 
, leading to softening of the deviatoric stress components. The
bulk stiffness, however, will be degraded only while the material is subjected to negative pressures (that is,
hydrostatic tension); there is no bulk degradation under positive pressures. This corresponds to a ﬂuid-like
behavior. Therefore, the degraded deviatoric, , and pressure, p, stresses are computed as
where the deviatoric and volumetric damage variables are given as
In this case the output variable SDEG contains the value of 
.
Elements with Three-Dimensional Stress States in Abaqus/Standard
For elements with three-dimensional stress states (including generalized plane strain elements) the stiffness will
be degraded uniformly until the maximum degradation, 
, is reached. Output variable SDEG contains the
value of D.
Elements with Plane Stress States
For elements with a plane stress formulation (plane stress, shell, continuum shell, and membrane elements) the
stiffness will be degraded uniformly until the maximum degradation, 
, is reached. Output variable SDEG
contains the value of D.
Elements with One-Dimensional Stress States
For elements with a one-dimensional stress state (i.e., truss elements, rebar, and cohesive elements with gasket
behavior) their only stress component will be degraded if it is positive (tension). The material stiffness will
remain unaffected under compression loading. The stress is, therefore, given by

Convergence Difficulties in Abaqus/Standard
Material models exhibiting softening behavior and stiffness degradation often lead to severe convergence
difﬁculties in implicit analysis programs, such as Abaqus/Standard. Some techniques are available in
Abaqus/Standard to improve convergence for analyses involving these materials.
Viscous Regularization in Abaqus/Standard
You can overcome some of the convergence difﬁculties associated with softening and stiffness degradation by
using the viscous regularization scheme, which causes the tangent stiffness matrix of the softening material to
be positive for sufﬁciently small time increments.
In this regularization scheme a viscous damage variable is deﬁned by the evolution equation:
where  is the viscosity coefﬁcient representing the relaxation time of the viscous system and d is the damage
variable evaluated in the inviscid base model. The damaged response of the viscous material is computed using
the viscous value of the damage variable. Using viscous regularization with a small value of the viscosity
parameter (small compared to the characteristic time increment) usually helps improve the rate of convergence
of the model in the softening regime, without compromising results. The basic idea is that the solution of the
viscous system relaxes to that of the inviscid case as 
, where t represents time.
In Abaqus/Standard you can specify the viscous coefﬁcients as part of a section controls deﬁnition. For more
information, see Using Viscous Regularization with Cohesive Elements, Connector Elements, and Elements That
Can Be Used with the Damage Evolution Models for Ductile Metals and Fiber-Reinforced Composites Including
the Multiscale Model for Fiber-Reinforced Composites in Abaqus/Standard.
Unsymmetric Equation Solver
In general, if any of the ductile evolution models is used, the material Jacobian matrix will be nonsymmetric.
To improve convergence, it is recommended that the unsymmetric equation solver is used in this case.
Using the Damage Models with Rebar
It is possible to use material damage models in elements for which rebar are also deﬁned. The base material
contribution to the element stress-carrying capacity diminishes according to the behavior described previously
in this section. The rebar contribution to the element stress-carrying capacity is not affected unless damage is
also included in the rebar material deﬁnition; in that case the rebar contribution to the element stress-carrying
capacity will also be degraded after the damage initiation criterion speciﬁed for the rebar is met. For the default
choice of element deletion, the element is removed from the mesh when at any one integration location all section
points in the base material and rebar are fully degraded.

criteria for ductile metals in Abaqus (Damage Initiation for Ductile Metals).

Overview
Abaqus/Standard and Abaqus/Explicit offer general capabilities for predicting the onset of damage and for modeling
progressive damage and failure in ﬁber-reinforced composites, which include unidirectional ﬁber-reinforced composite
materials and bidirectional fabric-reinforced composite materials. These capabilities require you to specify:
•
the undamaged response of the material, which must be linearly elastic (see Linear Elastic Behavior); optionally
in-plane shear plasticity is allowed for bidirectional fabric-reinforced composites (see Damage Initiation for
Fiber-Reinforced Composites and Damage Evolution and Element Removal for Fiber-Reinforced Composites);
•
a damage initiation criterion (see About Progressive Damage and Failure and Damage Initiation for Fiber-Reinforced
Composites); and
•
a damage evolution response (except as noted below), including a choice of element removal (see About Progressive
Damage and Failure and Damage Evolution and Element Removal for Fiber-Reinforced Composites).
Undamaged Response
Unidirectional ﬁber-reinforced composite materials exhibit elastic-brittle behavior; damage in these materials
is initiated without signiﬁcant plastic deformation. Consequently, plasticity is often neglected when modeling
behavior of these materials. You must specify material properties in a user-deﬁned local coordinate system, with
the local 1-direction aligned with the ﬁber direction, as shown in Figure 1. You can use any of the available
methods to deﬁne orthotropic elastic behavior to deﬁne the undamaged response.

Figure 1: Unidirectional lamina.
For bidirectional fabric-reinforced composite materials, the shear response is dominated by the nonlinear behavior
of the matrix, which includes both plasticity and stiffness degradation due to matrix microcracking. The ﬁber
directions are assumed to be orthogonal. You must specify material properties in a user-deﬁned local coordinate
system, with the local 1-direction and 2-direction aligned with the ﬁber directions, as shown in Figure 2. The
material response along the ﬁber directions is characterized with damaged elasticity. The model incorporates
different initial (undamaged) stiffness in tension and compression and differentiates between tensile and
compressive ﬁber failure modes. Therefore, you must use bilamina elasticity to deﬁne the undamaged response
(see Deﬁning Orthotropic Elasticity in Plane Stress with Different Moduli in Tension and Compression).

Damage Initiation Criteria
Abaqus offers the following damage initiation criteria for unidirectional ﬁber-reinforced composites:
•
Hashin model, based on the work of Matzenmiller et al. (1995), Hashin and Rotem (1973), Hashin (1980),
and Camanho and Davila (2002).
•
LaRC05 model (available only in Abaqus/Standard), based on the work of Pinho et al. (2012).
Abaqus Materials Guide
506
About Damage and Failure for Fiber-Reinforced Composites

Abaqus offers the following damage initiation criterion for bidirectional fabric-reinforced composites:
•
Ply fabric model (available only in Abaqus/Explicit), based on the work of Johnson (2001) and Sokolinsky
et al. (2011).
These models include initiation criteria for various failure mechanisms commonly observed in ﬁber-reinforced
composites, such as ﬁber fracture in tension, ﬁber buckling/kinking under compression, and matrix
cracking/crushing under tension/compression. These criteria are discussed in Damage Initiation for
Fiber-Reinforced Composites.
Once a particular damage initiation criterion is satisﬁed, the material stiffness is degraded according to the
speciﬁed damage evolution law for that criterion. In the absence of a damage evolution law, the material stiffness
is not degraded.
Damage Evolution
The damage evolution law describes the rate of degradation of the material stiffness once the corresponding
initiation criterion is reached. At any given time during the analysis, the stress tensor in the material is given by:
where 
 is the damaged elasticity matrix. Abaqus assumes that the degradation of the stiffness of the ﬁber and
matrix components can be expressed in terms of three scalar damage variables that reﬂect the current states of
ﬁber, matrix, and shear damages, respectively. The evolution of the elasticity matrix due to damage is discussed
in more detail in Damage Evolution and Element Removal for Fiber-Reinforced Composites; that section also
discusses:
•
options for treating severe damage (Maximum Degradation and Choice of Element Removal); and
•
viscous regularization (Viscous Regularization).
The LaRC05 damage initiation model supports damage evolution only when used with enriched elements to
model discontinuities (such as cracks) in an extended ﬁnite element method (XFEM) analysis. For more
information, see Modeling Discontinuities as an Enriched Feature Using the Extended Finite Element Method.
Elements
The Hashin damage model and ply fabric damage model must be used with elements with a plane stress
formulation, which include plane stress, shell, continuum shell, and membrane elements. The LaRC05 damage
model is available with three-dimensional solid, plane stress, shell, solid shell, and membrane elements.

Overview
The material damage initiation capability for ﬁber-reinforced materials:
•
is intended as a general capability for predicting initiation of damage in ﬁber-reinforced composite materials;
•
is based on the Hashin (Hashin and Rotem, 1973, and Hashin, 1980) or the LaRC05 (Pinho et al. (2012)) models
for unidirectional ﬁber-reinforced composites or on the ply fabric (Johnson, 2001 and Sokolinsky et al., 2011)
model for bidirectional fabric-reinforced composites;
•
takes into account different failure modes involving the response of the ﬁber and the matrix components to various
loading conditions (the failure modes depend on which model you use); and
•
can be used with damage evolution models with the following restriction: the LaRC05 model supports damage
evolution only when used with enriched elements to model discontinuities (such as cracks) in an extended ﬁnite
element method (XFEM) analysis.
Damage Initiation
Damage initiation refers to the onset of degradation at a material point. Abaqus supports two damage initiation
criteria for unidirectional ﬁber-reinforced composites: the Hashin criterion and the LaRC05 criterion; and the
ply fabric damage initiation criterion for bidirectional fabric-reinforced composites.
Damage is characterized by the degradation of material stiffness. It plays an important role in the analysis of
ﬁber-reinforced composite materials.
Unidirectional ﬁber-reinforced composite materials exhibit elastic-brittle behavior; that is, damage in these
materials is initiated without signiﬁcant plastic deformation. Consequently, plasticity is often neglected when
modeling the behavior of these materials. The ﬁbers in the ﬁber-reinforced material are assumed to be parallel,
as depicted in Figure 1.

Figure 1: Unidirectional lamina.
For unidirectional ﬁber-reinforced composite materials, you must specify material properties in a user-deﬁned
local coordinate system. The lamina is in the 1–2 plane, and the local 1-direction corresponds to the ﬁber direction.
You must specify the undamaged material response using one of the methods for deﬁning an orthotropic linear
elastic material (see Linear Elastic Behavior); the most convenient of which is the method for deﬁning an
orthotropic material in plane stress (see Deﬁning Orthotropic Elasticity in Plane Stress). However, the material
response can also be deﬁned in terms of the engineering constants or by specifying the elastic stiffness matrix
directly.
For bidirectional fabric-reinforced composite materials, the shear response is dominated by the nonlinear behavior
of the matrix, which includes both plasticity and stiffness degradation due to matrix microcracking. The ﬁber
directions are assumed to be orthogonal. You must specify material properties in a user-deﬁned local coordinate
system, with the local 1-direction and 2-direction aligned with the ﬁber directions, as shown in
#unique_1156/unique_1156_Connect_42_simamat-c-init-fabricreinforcedmaterial. The material response along
the ﬁber directions is characterized with damaged elasticity, and the model differentiates between tensile and
compressive ﬁber failure modes. The elastic undamaged response of the material must be deﬁned using the
bilamina elasticity model (see Deﬁning Orthotropic Elasticity in Plane Stress with Different Moduli in Tension
and Compression).
Hashin Criterion
The Abaqus anisotropic damage model for unidirectional ﬁber-reinforced composite is based on the work of
Matzenmiller et al. (1995), Hashin and Rotem (1973), Hashin (1980), and Camanho and Davila (2002).
Four different modes of failure are considered:
•
ﬁber rupture in tension;
•
ﬁber buckling and kinking in compression;
•
matrix cracking under transverse tension and shearing; and
•
matrix crushing under transverse compression and shearing.
The initiation criteria have the following general forms:

discussed, as follows:
Prior to any damage initiation and evolution the damage operator,

.
Once damage initiation and evolution has occurred for at least one mode, the damage operator becomes signiﬁcant
in the criteria for damage initiation of other modes (see Damage Evolution and Element Removal for
Fiber-Reinforced Composites for discussion of damage evolution). The effective stress, , is intended to represent
the stress acting over the damaged area that effectively resists the internal forces.
The initiation criteria presented above can be specialized to obtain the model proposed in Hashin and Rotem
(1973) by setting 
 and 
 or the model proposed in Hashin (1980) by setting 
.
An output variable is associated with each initiation criterion (ﬁber tension, ﬁber compression, matrix tension,
matrix compression) to indicate whether the criterion has been met. A value of 1.0 or higher indicates that the
initiation criterion has been met (see Output for further details). If you deﬁne a damage initiation model without
deﬁning an associated evolution law, the initiation criteria will affect only output. Thus, you can use these criteria
to evaluate the propensity of the material to undergo damage without modeling the damage process.

Ply Fabric Criterion
The ply fabric damage initiation criterion for bidirectional ﬁber-reinforced composite (available only in
Abaqus/Explicit) is an anisotropic damage model based on the work of Johnson, 2001 and Sokolinsky et al.,
2011. The material response along the ﬁber directions is characterized with damaged elasticity. The model
incorporates different initial (undamaged) stiffness in tension and compression (see Deﬁning Orthotropic Elasticity
in Plane Stress with Different Moduli in Tension and Compression), and differentiates between tensile and
compressive ﬁber failure modes by activating the corresponding damage variable depending on the stress state
in the ﬁber directions. The shear response is dominated by the nonlinear behavior of the matrix, which includes
both plasticity (see Plasticity Model for Bidirectional Fabric-Reinforced Composite Materials) and stiffness
degradation due to matrix microcracking.
Four different modes of damage initiation for the ﬁbers and one for shear response of the matrix are considered:
•
Fiber rupture in tension in the local 1-direction, with a damage variable 
;
•
Fiber buckling and kinking in compression in the local 1-direction, with a damage variable 
;
•
Fiber rupture in tension in the local 2-direction, with a damage variable 
;
•
Fiber buckling and kinking in compression in the local 2-direction, with a damage variable 
; and
•
Matrix microcracking due to shear deformation, with a damage variable 
.
The four ﬁber damage initiation criteria have the following general form:
In the above equation, an index  is used to simplify notation and is used in subsequent discussions, such that
it takes the values

with increasing damage according to:
Once a particular damage initiation criterion is satisﬁed, the material stiffness is degraded according to the
speciﬁed damage evolution law for that criterion. For a discussion of damage evolution, see Damage Evolution
and Element Removal for Fiber-Reinforced Composites.
An output variable is associated with each initiation criterion (ﬁber tension in the local 1-direction, ﬁber
compression in the local 1-direction, ﬁber tension in the local 2-direction, ﬁber compression in the local
2-direction, and matrix shear) to indicate whether the criterion has been met. A value of 1.0 or higher indicates
that the initiation criterion has been met (for more details, see Output). If you deﬁne a damage initiation model
without deﬁning an associated evolution law, the initiation criteria affects only output. Therefore, you can use
these criteria to evaluate the propensity of the material to undergo damage without modeling the damage process.

Output
In addition to the standard output identiﬁers available in Abaqus (Abaqus/Standard Output Variable Identiﬁers

For the variables above that indicate whether an initiation criterion in a damage mode has been satisﬁed or not,
a value that is less than 1.0 indicates that the criterion has not been satisﬁed, while a value of 1.0 or higher
indicates that the criterion has been satisﬁed. If you deﬁne a damage evolution model, the maximum value of
this variable does not exceed 1.0. However, if you do not deﬁne a damage evolution model, this variable can
have values higher than 1.0, which indicates by how much the criterion has been exceeded.

Damage Evolution for the Hashin Model
The previous section (Damage Initiation for Fiber-Reinforced Composites) discussed the damage initiation in
plane stress ﬁber-reinforced composites. This section will discuss the post-damage initiation behavior for cases
in which a damage evolution model has been speciﬁed. Prior to damage initiation the material is linearly elastic,
with the stiffness matrix of a plane stress orthotropic material. Thereafter, the response of the material is computed
from

Evolution of Damage Variables for Each Mode
To alleviate mesh dependency during material softening, Abaqus introduces a characteristic length into the
formulation, so that the constitutive law is expressed as a stress-displacement relation. The damage variable
evolves such that the stress-displacement behaves as shown in Figure 1 in each of the four failure modes. The
positive slope of the stress-displacement curve prior to damage initiation corresponds to linear elastic material
behavior; the negative slope after damage initiation is achieved by evolution of the respective damage variables
according to the equations shown below.

The characteristic length, 
, is based on the element geometry and formulation: it is a typical length of a line
across an element for a ﬁrst-order element; it is half of the same typical length for a second-order element. For
membranes and shells it is a characteristic length in the reference surface, computed as the square root of the
area. Alternatively, this characteristic length could be deﬁned as a function of the element topology and material
orientation in user subroutine VUCHARLENGTH (see Deﬁning the Characteristic Element Length at a Material
Point in Abaqus/Explicit). The symbol  in the equations above represents the Macaulay bracket operator, which
is deﬁned for every

After damage initiation (i.e., 
) for the behavior shown in Figure 1, the damage variable for a particular
mode is given by the following expression
where 
 is the initial equivalent displacement at which the initiation criterion for that mode was met and 
is the displacement at which the material is completely damaged in this failure mode. The above relation is
presented graphically in Figure 2.

Damage Evolution for the Ply Fabric Model
The ply fabric damage initiation criterion for bidirectional fabric-reinforced composites is described in Damage
Initiation for Fiber-Reinforced Composites. This section discusses the post-damage initiation behavior for cases
in which a damage evolution model is speciﬁed.
The elastic stress-strain relations are given by orthotropic damaged bilamina elasticity (see Deﬁning Orthotropic
Elasticity in Plane Stress with Different Moduli in Tension and Compression). Thereafter, the damaged elastic
response of the plane stress orthotropic material in the local orthogonal coordinate is computed from
where 
 is the elastic strain, and 
 is the damaged elasticity matrix. The damaged elasticity matrix has the
form

using bilamina elasticity (see Deﬁning Orthotropic Elasticity in Plane Stress with Different Moduli in Tension
and Compression).
Evolution of Damage Variables for Each Mode
For the four damage variables 
, 
 associated with ﬁber failure, the evolution of these
damage variables is a function of the damage thresholds and the fracture energy per unit area under uniaxial
tensile/compressive loading, 
. The evolution of the damage variables is given by the equation:
where
Here, 
 is the characteristic length of the element, 
 is the fracture energy per unit area under uniaxial
tensile/compressive loading, and 
 is the elastic energy density (that is. per unit volume) at the point of damage
initiation:
where 
 are the tensile/compressive strengths for uniaxial loading along the ﬁber directions. The formulation
of the damage evolution law ensures that the damage variables are monotonically increasing quantities. It also
ensures that the correct amount of energy is dissipated when the lamina is subjected to uniaxial loading conditions
along the ﬁber directions.
The characteristic length, 
, is based on the element geometry and formulation. It is a typical length of a line
across an element for a ﬁrst-order element; it is half of the same typical length for a second-order element. For
membrane and shell elements it is a characteristic length in the reference surface, computed as the square root
of the area. Alternatively, you can deﬁne this characteristic length as a function of the element topology and
material orientation in user subroutine VUCHARLENGTH (see Deﬁning the Characteristic Element Length at
a Material Point in Abaqus/Explicit).
It is assumed that the shear damage variable 
 increases with the logarithm of 
 until a maximum value 
is reached. Thus:

ﬁber failure modes is based on the fracture energy per unit area of the material, 
, which can be measured
experimentally.
The shear response is usually calibrated with a cyclic tensile test on a 
 laminate, where the strains along
the ﬁber directions can be neglected. Figure 4 shows the typical shear response of a fabric-reinforced composite.
The unloading/reloading paths correspond to an idealization of the actual response, which usually exhibits
hysteretic behavior. Figure 4 serves as a starting point for the discussion of a general calibration procedure for
the parameters that enter the damage and plasticity equations.

then used to ﬁt the Johnson-Cook parameters of the yield function or, alternatively, they can be used directly as
tabular input of the hardening curve.
Maximum Degradation and Choice of Element Removal
You have control over how Abaqus treats elements with severe damage. By default, the upper bound to all
damage variables at a material point is 
. You can reduce this upper bound as discussed in Controlling
Element Deletion and Maximum Degradation for Materials with Damage Evolution.
In Abaqus/Standard a material point is considered to fail once all failure modes reach 
. In Abaqus/Explicit
a material point is assumed to fail when either of the damage variables associated with ﬁber failure modes (tensile
or compressive) reaches 
. By default, an element is deleted from a mesh upon material failure. Details for
element deletion driven by material failure are described in Material Failure and Element Deletion. The status
of a material point and an element can be determined by requesting output variables STATUSMP and STATUS,
respectively.
Alternatively, you can specify that an element should remain in the model even after all of the damage variables
reach 
 (see Controlling Element Deletion and Maximum Degradation for Materials with Damage Evolution).
In this case, once all of the damage variables reach the maximum value, the stiffness, 
, remains constant (see
the expression for 
 earlier in this section).
For ply fabric damage evolution (available only in Abaqus/Explicit), you have more control over the criteria for
material failure. You can consider a material point to fail if any one of the following criteria is met:
•
when either ﬁber damage variable reaches a speciﬁed maximum value 
 or 
, or when
both ﬁber damage variables reach the maximum speciﬁed value 
 and 
;
•
when the shear plastic strain reaches a speciﬁed maximum value, 
; or

526

•
when a deformation-based material failure criterion depending on the values of the maximum (
)
and minimum (
) principal logarithmic strains that the material can sustain is met.
If you do not deﬁne conditions that trigger material failure for the ply fabric model, the material point fails when
either ﬁber damage variable reaches a speciﬁed maximum value.

Abaqus/CAE Usage:
Viscous Regularization
Material models exhibiting softening behavior and stiffness degradation often lead to severe convergence
difﬁculties in implicit analysis programs, such as Abaqus/Standard. You can overcome some of these convergence
difﬁculties by using the viscous regularization scheme, which causes the tangent stiffness matrix of the softening
material to be positive for sufﬁciently small time increments.
In this regularization scheme a viscous damage variable is deﬁned by the evolution equation:
where  is the viscosity coefﬁcient representing the relaxation time of the viscous system and d is the damage
variable evaluated in the inviscid backbone model. The damaged response of the viscous material is given as
where the damaged elasticity matrix, 
, is computed using viscous values of damage variables for each failure
mode. Using viscous regularization with a small value of the viscosity parameter (small compared to the
characteristic time increment) usually helps improve the rate of convergence of the model in the softening regime,
without compromising results. The basic idea is that the solution of the viscous system relaxes to that of the
inviscid case as 
, where t represents time.
Viscous regularization is also available in Abaqus/Explicit for the Hashin damage model. Viscous regularization
slows down the rate of increase of damage and leads to increased fracture energy with increasing deformation
rates, which can be exploited as an effective method of modeling rate-dependent material behavior.
In Abaqus/Standard the approximate amount of energy associated with viscous regularization over the whole
model or over an element set is available using output variable ALLCD.
You cannot use the viscous regularization scheme with damage evolution for the ply fabric damage initiation
criterion.

Alternatively, in Abaqus/Standard you can specify the viscous coefﬁcients as part of a section controls deﬁnition.
In this case the same viscous coefﬁcient is applied to all failure modes. For more information, see Using Viscous
Regularization with Cohesive Elements, Connector Elements, and Elements That Can Be Used with the Damage

Material Damping
If stiffness proportional damping is speciﬁed in combination with the damage evolution law for ﬁber-reinforced
materials, Abaqus calculates the damping stresses using the damaged elastic stiffness.

formulation, which include plane stress, shell, continuum shell, and membrane elements.

Overview
With this approach, damage and failure occurs at the constituent level in ﬁber-reinforced composites, including both
unidirectional and woven ﬁber-reinforced composite materials. These capabilities require you to specify:
•
the undamaged response of the ﬁber and matrix material in the composite, which must be linearly elastic (see Linear
Elastic Behavior and Multiscale Material Modeling);
•
the multiscale material deﬁnition for the composite, including the constituent material and the microstructure of
the composite (see Multiscale Material Modeling);
•
a damage initiation criterion in the ﬁber and matrix material (see Damage Initiation for Fiber-Reinforced Composites
Using Multiscale Modeling); and
•
a damage evolution response in the ﬁber and matrix material (see Damage Evolution for Fiber-Reinforced Composites
Using Multiscale Modeling) when modeling progressive damage.
The Multiscale Approach
Compared to the composite-level damage model (see About Damage and Failure for Fiber-Reinforced
Composites), the multiscale approach takes into account the constituent material behavior and the microstructure
of the composite (see Mean-Field Homogenization). The multiscale approach has an advantage over the traditional
composite-level approach because it can:
•
determine composite properties for any given volume fraction and other geometry speciﬁcations before the
composite is even manufactured, which facilitates the design process of new composite materials;
•
capture damage and failure at a more fundamental scale (the constituent level);
•
allow you to specify simpler constitutive models for the constituents;
•
allow you to specify simpler and more fundamental damage and failure criteria; and
•
capture progressive damage of the composite with simpler evolution laws at the constituent level.
Undamaged Response
Unidirectional ﬁber-reinforced composite materials exhibit elastic-brittle behavior; damage in these materials
is initiated without signiﬁcant plastic deformation. Consequently, plasticity is often neglected when modeling

the behavior of these materials. You must specify material properties in a user-deﬁned local coordinate system
with the local 1-direction aligned with the ﬁber direction. In addition, you must specify isotropic or transversely
isotropic elasticity in the constituent materials. You can also specify isotropic or transversely isotropic thermal
expansion in the constituent materials.

Abaqus supports woven composite materials that are made of orthogonal yarns (weave and weft) and matrix
material. The yarns are unidirectional ﬁber-reinforced composites and are considered to have a continuous
cylindrical inclusion with an elliptical cross-section shape. You must specify a multilevel multiscale material
model to specify damage and failure properties in the ﬁber and matrix constituents of the yarn. The yarn directions
must align with the local 1- and 2-directions of the composite material.

Damage Initiation Criteria
Abaqus/Standard offers the following damage initiation criteria for constituents inside the unidirectional
ﬁber-reinforced composites and woven composites:
•
Constituent-level failure criterion based on the work of Mayes (2001).
•
Matrix failure criterion based on the work of Shultz (2013).
These models include initiation criteria for various failure mechanisms commonly observed in ﬁber-reinforced
composites, such as ﬁber fracture in tension, ﬁber buckling/kinking under compression, and matrix
cracking/crushing under tension/compression, all at the constituent level.
Once a particular damage initiation criterion is satisﬁed, the material stiffness of the constituent is degraded
according to the speciﬁed damage evolution law for that criterion. The effective material behavior of the composite
can then be determined through homogenization. In the absence of a damage evolution law, the material stiffness
is not degraded.
Damage Evolution
The damage evolution law describes the rate of degradation of the material stiffness once the corresponding
initiation criterion is reached. At any given time during the analysis, the stress tensor in the material is given by
where 
 is the damaged elasticity matrix. The evolution of the elasticity matrix arising from damage is discussed
in more detail in Damage Evolution for Fiber-Reinforced Composites Using Multiscale Modeling; that section
also discusses viscous regularization (Viscous Regularization).
Elements
The multiscale damage model can be used with any elements in Abaqus that include mechanical behavior; that
is, elements that have displacement degrees of freedom.

Overview
The material damage initiation capability for ﬁber-reinforced materials using multiscale modeling:

Damage Initiation
Damage initiation refers to the onset of degradation at a material point. Abaqus/Standard supports the failure
criterion by Mayes (2001), who followed the work by Hashin (1980). The general form of Hashin's quadratic
failure criterion is
where 
 are the transversely isotropic stress invariants written as
Based on the theory of Mayes (2001), Hashin's quadratic criterion can be simpliﬁed into the constituent-level
criterion by dropping the linear term (accounted for by multiscale modeling) and ignoring the normal stress
interaction term

Allowable Stress
You can choose not to specify the coefﬁcients directly in the deﬁnition of the constituent damage criterion. In
that case you need to specify the allowable stress of the composite in the multiscale material deﬁnition. Then
Abaqus/Standard computes the volume-averaged constituent stresses using the homogenization method speciﬁed,
and the failure criterion coefﬁcients using the equations above. When you specify the allowable stresses at the
composite level, Abaqus/Standard ignores failure coefﬁcients speciﬁed at the constituent level.
In a woven composite matrix, failure can occur before the ultimate failure of the composite. In addition to the
ultimate composite strengths, you must specify the strengths of the composite at the initial failure of the matrix
inside the tows.

Output
In addition to the standard output identiﬁers available in Abaqus/Standard (Abaqus/Standard Output Variable
Identiﬁers), the following variables relate speciﬁcally to damage initiation at a material point in the ﬁber-reinforced
composite damage model:
All damage initiation criteria components.

Maximum value of the ﬁber tensile initiation criterion experienced during the
analysis when the HSNFIBER criterion is speciﬁed.
HSNFTCRT
Maximum value of the ﬁber compressive initiation criterion experienced during
the analysis when the HSNFIBER criterion is speciﬁed.

Maximum value of the matrix tensile initiation criterion experienced during the
analysis when the HSNMATRIX criterion is speciﬁed.
HSNMTCRT
Maximum value of the matrix compressive initiation criterion experienced during
the analysis when the HSNMATRIX criterion is speciﬁed.
HSNMCCRT
Maximum value of the matrix tensile initiation criterion experienced during the
analysis when the TSINVMATRIX criterion is speciﬁed.
TSINVMTCRT
Maximum value of the matrix compressive initiation criterion experienced during
the analysis when the TSINVMATRIX criterion is speciﬁed.
TSINVMCCRT
For the variables above associated with a damage initiation criterion, a value that is less than 1.0 indicates that
the criterion has not been satisﬁed, while a value of 1.0 or higher indicates that the criterion has been satisﬁed.
If you deﬁne a damage evolution model, the maximum value of this variable does not exceed 1.0; if you do not
deﬁne a damage evolution model, this variable can have values higher than 1.0, which indicates the degree to
which the criterion has been exceeded.

Overview
The damage evolution capability for multiscale ﬁber-reinforced materials in Abaqus/Standard:
•
assumes that damage is characterized by progressive degradation of the material stiffness, leading to material failure;
•
models the degradation of the composite at the constituent level, leading to composite-level failure through
homogenization;
•
requires the undamaged response of the material to be linear elastic (see Linear Elastic Behavior);
•
offers options to model energy dissipation in each constituent during the damage process in a unidirectional
ﬁber-reinforced composite;
•
offers options to model instantaneous degradation of material stiffness with user-speciﬁed scaling factors (this
method is the only option for modeling the progressive damage of a woven composite); and
•
can be used in combination with a viscous regularization scheme to improve the convergence rate in the softening
regime.
Damage Evolution
Damage Initiation for Fiber-Reinforced Composites Using Multiscale Modeling discussed the constituent-level
damage initiation in ﬁber-reinforced composites. This section discusses the post-damage initiation behavior for
cases in which a damage evolution model has been speciﬁed. The damage evolution is modeled at the constituent
level, leading to the damage process of a composite through homogenization. Prior to damage initiation, the
constituent material is linearly elastic, with the stiffness matrix of an isotropic or a transversely isotropic material.
Thereafter, the response of the constituent material is computed from
where 
 is the elastic strain, and 
 is the damaged elasticity matrix, which has the form
where 
 is the damage variable and 
 is the undamaged stiffness matrix of the constituent.
The damage variables, , are derived from damage variables in each constituent based on tension or compression
modes, as follows:

 are components of the effective stress tensor at the constituent level.
Evolution of Damage Variables for Each Mode
To alleviate mesh dependency during material softening, Abaqus introduces a characteristic length into the
formulation so that the constitutive law is expressed in a stress-displacement relation. The damage variable
evolves such that the stress-displacement behaves as shown in Figure 1 in each of the two failure modes (tension
and compression). The positive slope of the stress-displacement curve before damage initiation corresponds to
linear elastic material behavior; the negative slope after damage initiation is achieved by evolution of the respective
damage variables according to the equations shown below.

After damage initiation (that is, 
) for the behavior shown in Figure 1, the damage variable for a particular
mode is given by the following expression:
where

is the displacement at which the material is completely damaged in this failure mode. The relation above is
presented graphically in Figure 2.

You can specify the post-damage residual stiffness scaling factor directly for the tension and compression failure
modes. The scaling factor is related to the damage variable as
When a small scaling factor is speciﬁed at the onset of damage initiation, the sudden stiffness degradation often
leads to convergence difﬁculties in implicit analyses. Discontinuous solutions also require a larger number of
iterations to reach convergence (see Commonly Used Control Parameters for information about how to modify
solution control parameters to achieve better convergence). You can also use the viscous regularization scheme
described below (Viscous Regularization) to overcome these difﬁculties.

Maximum Degradation
When a fracture energy is speciﬁed for damage evolution, Abaqus/Standard limits the damage variable at a
constituent to a maximum value of 0.99 in both tension and failure modes. You can modify this upper bound as
discussed in Controlling Element Deletion and Maximum Degradation for Materials with Damage Evolution.
Abaqus/Standard does not delete elements after failure with this multiscale damage model.
Viscous Regularization
Material models exhibiting softening behavior and stiffness degradation often lead to severe convergence
difﬁculties in implicit analysis programs such as Abaqus/Standard. You can overcome some of these convergence
difﬁculties using the viscous regularization scheme, which slows down the rate of increase of damage.
In this regularization scheme, a viscous damage variable is deﬁned by the evolution equation:
where  is the viscosity coefﬁcient representing the relaxation time of the viscous system, and d is the damage
variable evaluated in the inviscid backbone model. The damaged response of the viscous material is given as
where the damaged elasticity matrix, 
, is computed using viscous values of damage variables. Using viscous
regularization with a small value of the viscosity parameter (small compared to the characteristic time increment)
usually helps improve the rate of convergence of the model in the softening regime without compromising results.
The basic idea is that the solution of the viscous system relaxes to that of the inviscid case as 
, where
t represents time.

Overview
Damage evolution laws are not supported for these general stress- and strain-based damage initiation criteria. Therefore,
Abaqus evaluates the initiation criterion for output purposes only, and the deﬁnition has no effect on the material
response. You can specify more than one damage initiation criterion for a given material. If you specify multiple
damage initiation criteria for the same material, the solver treats them independently. The output is in the form of a
failure index that provides information about the proximity to failure.
The generalized stress- and strain-based damage initiation criteria provide failure measures that:
•
are indicators of material failure;
•
are postprocessed output requests and do not cause any material degradation;
•
can be used with all stress/displacement elements; and
•
can be strain rate–dependent in Abaqus/Explicit.
Damage Initiation Criterion
Abaqus provides the following damage initiation criteria based on different failure theories that can be used as
indicators of material failure:
•
Maximum stress theory and maximum strain theory.
•
Stress- and strain-based Tsai-Wu theory (Tsai (1971)).
For each criterion, stresses and strains are measured in the local material coordinate system.
Elements
The general stress- and strain-based damage initiation criteria can be used with any elements in Abaqus that
include mechanical behavior (elements that have displacement degrees of freedom).

Overview
Abaqus/Standard offers a general capability for modeling progressive damage and failure of ductile materials due to
stress reversals and the accumulation of inelastic strain energy in a low-cycle fatigue analysis using the direct cyclic
approach. In the most general case this requires the speciﬁcation of the following:
•
the undamaged ductile materials in any elements (including cohesive elements based on a continuum approach)
whose response is deﬁned in terms of a continuum-based constitutive model (About the Material Library);
•
a damage initiation criterion (Damage Initiation for Ductile Materials in Low-Cycle Fatigue); and
•
a damage evolution response (Damage Evolution for Ductile Materials in Low-Cycle Fatigue).
A summary of the general framework for progressive damage and failure in Abaqus is given in About Progressive
Damage and Failure. This section provides an overview of the damage initiation criteria and damage evolution law
for ductile materials in a low-cycle fatigue analysis using the direct cyclic approach.
General Concepts of Damage of Ductile Materials in Low-Cycle Fatigue
Accurately and effectively predicting the fatigue life for an inelastic structure, such as a solder joint in an electronic
chip packaging, subjected to sub-critical cyclic loading is a challenging problem. Cyclic thermal or mechanical
loading often leads to stress reversals and the accumulation of inelastic strain, which may in turn lead to the
initiation and propagation of a crack. The low-cycle fatigue analysis capability in Abaqus/Standard uses a direct
cyclic approach (Low-Cycle Fatigue Analysis Using the Direct Cyclic Approach) to model progressive damage
and failure based on a continuum damage approach. The damage initiation (Damage Initiation for Ductile
Materials in Low-Cycle Fatigue) and evolution (Damage Evolution for Ductile Materials in Low-Cycle Fatigue)
are characterized by the stabilized accumulated inelastic hysteresis strain energy per cycle proposed by Darveaux
(2002) and Lau (2002).
The damage evolution law describes the rate of degradation of the material stiffness per cycle once the
corresponding initiation criterion has been reached. For damage in ductile materials Abaqus/Standard assumes
that the degradation of the stiffness can be modeled using a scalar damage variable, . At any given cycle during
the analysis the stress tensor in the material is given by the scalar damage equation
where  is the effective (or undamaged) stress tensor that would exist in the material in the absence of damage
computed in the current increment. The material has lost its load-carrying capacity when 
.

Overview
The material damage initiation capability for ductile materials based on inelastic hysteresis energy:
•
is intended as a general capability for predicting initiation of damage in ductile materials in a low-cycle fatigue
analysis;
•
can be used in combination with the damage evolution law for ductile materials described in Damage Evolution
for Ductile Materials in Low-Cycle Fatigue; and
•
can be used only in a low-cycle fatigue analysis using the direct cyclic approach (Low-Cycle Fatigue Analysis
Using the Direct Cyclic Approach).
Damage Initiation Criteria for Ductile Materials
The damage initiation criterion is a phenomenological model for predicting the onset of damage due to stress
reversals and the accumulation of inelastic strain in a low-cycle fatigue analysis. It is characterized by the
accumulated inelastic hysteresis energy density per cycle, 
, in a material point for a stabilized cycle. The
cycle number in which damage is initiated is given by
where 
 and 
 are material constants, and 
 is a reference value of the accumulated inelastic hysteresis
energy density per cycle.
The use of the reference energy density, 
, makes the above form of the damage initiation law different from
the more standard Cofﬁn-Manson type relations. It is recommended that for 
 (which has units of energy
density), you choose a value of 1.0 in the unit system in which the initiation law is calibrated to the available
test data. If a different unit system is then used, you must convert the material constant 
 based on its dimension
of cycle. In this case, you must also convert 
 appropriately to the new system to ensure that the physical
results are invariant to the choice of the unit system.
The initiation criterion can be used in conjunction with any ductile material.

Damage Evolution Based on Accumulated Inelastic Hysteresis Energy Density
Once the damage initiation criterion (Damage Initiation for Ductile Materials in Low-Cycle Fatigue) is satisﬁed
at a material point, the damage state is calculated and updated based on the accumulated inelastic hysteresis
energy density per cycle, 
, for a stabilized cycle. The rate of the damage in a material point per cycle is given
by
where 
 and 
 are material constants,  is the characteristic length associated with an integration point, and
 is a reference value of the accumulated inelastic hysteresis energy density per cycle.
The use of the reference energy density,

from the more standard Cofﬁn-Manson type relations. It is recommended that for

Mesh Dependency and Characteristic Length
The implementation of the damage evolution model requires the deﬁnition of a characteristic length associated
with an integration point. The characteristic length is based on the element geometry and formulation: it is a
typical length of a line across an element for a ﬁrst-order element; it is half of the same typical length for a
second-order element. For beams and trusses it is a characteristic length along the element axis. For membranes
and shells it is a characteristic length in the reference surface. For axisymmetric elements it is a characteristic
length in the r–z plane only. For cohesive elements it is equal to the constitutive thickness. This deﬁnition of
the characteristic length is used because the direction in which fracture occurs is not known in advance. Therefore,
elements with large aspect ratios will have rather different behavior depending on the direction in which the
damage occurs: some mesh sensitivity remains because of this effect, and elements that are as close to square
as possible are recommended. However, since the damage evolution law is energy based, mesh dependency of
the results may be alleviated.
Maximum Degradation and Element Removal
You can control how Abaqus/Standard treats elements with severe damage.
Defining the Upper Bound to the Damage Variable

Hydrodynamic Properties

Hydrodynamic Behavior
Overview
The material library in Abaqus/Explicit includes several equation of state models to describe the hydrodynamic behavior
of materials.
An equation of state is a constitutive equation that deﬁnes the pressure as a function of the density and the internal
energy (Equation of State).
The following equations of state are supported in Abaqus/Explicit:
Mie-Grüneisen equation of state
The Mie-Grüneisen equation of state (Mie-Grüneisen Equations of State) is used to model materials at high
pressure. It is linear in energy and assumes a linear relationship between the shock velocity and the particle
velocity.
Tabulated equation of state
The tabulated equation of state (Tabulated Equation of State) is used to model the hydrodynamic response of
materials that exhibit sharp transitions in the pressure-density relationship, such as those induced by phase
transformations. It is linear in energy.
P–alpha equation of state
The 
 equation of state (P–alpha Equation of State) is designed for modeling the compaction of ductile
porous materials. The constitutive model captures the irreversible compaction behavior at low stresses and
predicts the correct thermodynamic behavior at high pressures for the fully compacted solid material. It is used
in combination with either the Mie-Grüneisen equation of state or the tabulated equation of state to describe the
solid phase.
JWL high explosive equation of state
The Jones-Wilkins-Lee (or JWL) equation of state (JWL High Explosive Equation of State) models the pressure
generated by the release of chemical energy in an explosive. This model is implemented in a form referred to as
a programmed burn, which means that the reaction and initiation of the explosive is not determined by shock in
the material. Instead, the initiation time is determined by a geometric construction using the detonation wave
speed and the distance of the material point from the detonation points.
Ideal gas equation of state
The ideal gas equation of state (Ideal Gas Equation of State) is an idealization to real gas behavior and can be
used to model any gases approximately under appropriate conditions (e.g., low pressure and high temperature).

The material modeled by an equation of state may have no deviatoric strength or may have either isotropic elastic
or viscous (both Newtonian and non-Newtonian) deviatoric behavior (Deviatoric Behavior). The elastic model
can be used by itself or in conjunction with the Mises, the Johnson-Cook, or the extended Drucker-Prager
plasticity models to model hydrodynamic materials with elastic-plastic deviatoric behavior.

Energy Equation and Hugoniot Curve
The equation for conservation of energy equates the increase in internal energy per unit mass, 
, to the rate at
which work is being done by the stresses and the rate at which heat is being added. In the absence of heat
conduction the energy equation can be written as
where p is the pressure stress deﬁned as positive in compression, 
 is the pressure stress due to the bulk
viscosity,  is the deviatoric stress tensor,  is the deviatoric part of strain rate, and  is the heat rate per unit
mass.
The equation of state is assumed for the pressure as a function of the current density, , and the internal energy
per unit mass, 
:
which deﬁnes all the equilibrium states that can exist in a material. The internal energy can be eliminated from
the above equation to obtain a p versus V relationship (where V is the current volume) or, equivalently, a p versus
 relationship that is unique to the material described by the equation of state model. This unique relationship
is called the Hugoniot curve and is the locus of p–V states achievable behind a shock (see Figure 1).

The equation of state and the energy equation represent coupled equations for pressure and internal energy.
Abaqus/Explicit solves these equations simultaneously at each material point.

A common ﬁt to the Hugoniot data is given by

 Hugoniot form of the equation of

With the above assumptions the linear 
 Hugoniot form is written as

 is equivalent to the elastic bulk modulus at small nominal strains.
There is a limiting compression given by the denominator of this form of the equation of state
or
At this limit there is a tensile minimum; thereafter, negative sound speeds are calculated for the material.

User-Defined Equation of State
The user-deﬁned equation of state provides a general capability for modeling the volumetric response of materials
through user subroutine VUEOS (see VUEOS). The equation of state deﬁnes the pressure as a function of the
current density, , and the internal energy per unit mass, 
: 
. Abaqus/Explicit solves the energy
equation together with the equation of state using an iterative method. The pressure stress, , and the derivatives
of the pressure with respect to the internal energy and to the density, 
 and 
, must be provided
by user subroutine VUEOS. The latter is needed for the evaluation of the effective bulk modulus of the material,
which is necessary for the stable time increment calculation.

P–alpha Equation of State
The 
 equation of state is designed for modeling the compaction of ductile porous materials. The
implementation in Abaqus/Explicit is based on the model proposed by Hermann (1968) and Carroll and Holt
(1972). The constitutive model provides a detailed description of the irreversible compaction behavior at low
stresses and predicts the correct thermodynamic behavior at high pressures for the fully compacted solid material.
In Abaqus/Explicit the solid phase is assumed to be governed by either the Mie-Grüneisen equation of state or
the tabulated equation of state. The relevant properties of the porous material in the virgin state, to be discussed
later, and the material properties of the solid phase are speciﬁed separately.
The porosity of the material, n, is deﬁned as the ratio of pore volume, 
, to total volume, 
, where
 is the solid volume. The porosity remains in the range 
, with 0 indicating full compaction. It is
convenient to introduce a scalar variable , sometimes referred to as “distension,” deﬁned as the ratio of the
density of the solid material, 
, to the density of the porous material, , both evaluated at the same temperature
and pressure:
For a fully compacted material 
; otherwise,  is greater than 1. Assuming that the density of the pores is
negligible compared to that of the solid phase,  can be expressed in terms of the porosity n as
An equation of state is assumed for the pressure of the porous material as a function of ; current density, ;
and internal energy per unit mass, 
, in the form
Abaqus Materials Guide
568
Equation of State

Assuming that the pores carry no pressure, it follows from equilibrium considerations that when a pressure p is
applied to the porous material, it gives rise to a volume-average pressure in the solid phase equal to 
.
Assuming that the speciﬁc internal energies of the porous material and the solid matrix are the same (that is,
neglecting the surface energy of the pores), the equation of state of the porous material can be expressed as
where 
 is the equation of state of the solid material. For the fully compacted material (that is, when
), the 
 equation of state reduces to that of the solid phase, therefore predicting the correct
thermodynamic behavior at high pressures.
The 
 equation of state must be supplemented by an equation that describes the behavior of  as a function
of the thermodynamic state. This equation takes the form
where 
 is a state variable corresponding to the minimum value attained by  during plastic (irreversible)
compaction of the material. The state variable is initialized to the elastic limit 
 for a material that is at its virgin
state. The speciﬁc form of the function 
 used by Abaqus/Explicit is illustrated in Figure 2 and is
discussed next.

materials.
The function 
 captures the general behavior to be expected in a ductile porous material. The unloaded
virgin state corresponds to the value 
, where 
 is the reference porosity of the material. Initial
compression of the porous material is assumed to be elastic. Recall that decreasing porosity corresponds to a
reduction in . As the pressure increases beyond the elastic limit, 
, the pores in the material start to crush,
leading to irreversible compaction and permanent (plastic) volume change. Unloading from a partially compacted
state follows a new elastic curve that depends on the maximum compaction (or, alternatively, the minimum

elastic curve decreases as 
 decreases, as will be quantiﬁed later. The material becomes fully compacted
when the pressure reaches the compaction pressure 
; at that point 
, a value that is retained
forever. The function 
 therefore has multiple branches: a plastic branch, 
, and multiple elastic
branches, 
, corresponding to elastic unloading from partially compacted states. The appropriate
branch of A is selected according to the following rule:
These expressions can be inverted to solve for p:
The equation for the plastic curve takes the form
or, alternatively,
The elastic curve originally proposed by Hermann (1968) is given by the differential equation
where 
 is the elastic bulk modulus of the solid material at small nominal strains; 
 is the reference
density of the solid; and 
 and 
 are the reference sound speeds in the solid and virgin (porous) materials,
respectively.

sound speed,

the reference density is required to be constant; it cannot be a function of temperature or ﬁeld variables.

JWL High Explosive Equation of State
The Jones-Wilkins-Lee (or JWL) equation of state models the pressure generated by the release of chemical
energy in an explosive. This model is implemented in a form referred to as a programmed burn, which means
that the reaction and initiation of the explosive is not determined by shock in the material. Instead, the initiation
time is determined by a geometric construction using the detonation wave speed and the distance of the material
point from the detonation points.
The JWL equation of state can be written in terms of the internal energy per unit mass, 
, as

Arrival Time of Detonation Wave
Abaqus/Explicit calculates the arrival time of the detonation wave at a material point 
 as the distance from
the material point to the nearest detonation point divided by the detonation wave speed:
where 
 is the position of the material point, 
 is the position of the Nth detonation point, 
 is the detonation
delay time of the Nth detonation point, and 
 is the detonation wave speed of the explosive material. The
minimum in the above formula is over the N detonation points that apply to the material point.

572
Equation of State

Burn Fraction
To spread the burn wave over several elements, a burn fraction, 
, is computed as
where 
 is a constant that controls the width of the burn wave (set to a value of 2.5) and  is the characteristic
length of the element. If the time is less than 
, the pressure is zero in the explosive; otherwise, the pressure
is given by the product of 
 and the pressure determined from the JWL equation above.
Defining Detonation Points
You can deﬁne any number of detonation points for the explosive material. Coordinates of the points must be
deﬁned along with a detonation delay time. Each material point responds to the ﬁrst detonation point that it sees.
The detonation arrival time at a material point is based on the time that it takes a detonation wave (traveling at
the detonation wave speed 
) to reach the material point plus the detonation delay time for the detonation point.
If there are multiple detonation points, the arrival time is based on the minimum arrival time for all the detonation
points. In a body with curved surfaces care should be taken that the detonation arrival times are meaningful. The
detonation arrival times are based on the straight line of sight from the material point to the detonation point. In
a curved body the line of sight might pass outside of the body.

incorporate this stiffness when elements modeled with a JWL equation of state are subjected to stress before

.
The pressure will be computed from the volumetric strain and 
 until detonation, at which time the pressure
will be determined by the procedure outlined above. The initial relative density (

is assumed to be unity. The initial speciﬁc energy

Ideal Gas Equation of State
An ideal gas equation of state can be written in the form of
Abaqus Materials Guide
576
Equation of State

where 
 is the ambient pressure, R is the gas constant,  is the current temperature, and 
 is the absolute zero
on the temperature scale being used. It is an idealization to real gas behavior and can be used to model any gases
approximately under appropriate conditions (for example, low pressure and high temperature).
One of the important features of an ideal gas is that its speciﬁc energy depends only on its temperature; therefore,
the speciﬁc energy can be integrated numerically as
where 
 is the initial speciﬁc energy at the initial temperature 
 and 
 is the speciﬁc heat at constant volume
(or the constant volume heat capacity), which depends only on temperature for an ideal gas.
Modeling with an ideal gas equation of state is typically performed adiabatically; the temperature increase is
calculated directly at the material integration points according to the adiabatic thermal energy increase caused
by the work 
, where v is the speciﬁc volume (the volume per unit mass, 
). Therefore, unless a fully
coupled temperature-displacement analysis is performed, an adiabatic condition is always assumed in
Abaqus/Explicit.
When performing a fully coupled temperature-displacement analysis, the pressure stress and speciﬁc energy are
updated based on the evolving temperature ﬁeld. The energy increase due to the change in state will be accounted
for in the heat equation and will be subject to heat conduction.
For the ideal gas model in Abaqus/Explicit you deﬁne the gas constant, R, and the ambient pressure, 
. For an
ideal gas R can be determined from the universal gas constant, , and the molecular weight, 
, as follows:
In general, the value R for any gas can be estimated by plotting 
 as a function of state (for example,
pressure or temperature). The ideal gas approximation is adequate in any region where this value is constant.

Comparison with the Hydrostatic Fluid Model
The ideal gas equation of state can be used to model wave propagation effects and the dynamics of a spatially
varying state of a gaseous region. For cases in which the inertial effects of the gas are not important and the state
of the gas can be assumed to be uniform throughout a region, the hydrostatic ﬂuid model (About Surface-Based
Fluid Cavities) is a simpler, more computationally efﬁcient alternative.
Deviatoric Behavior
The equation of state deﬁnes only the material's hydrostatic behavior. It can be used by itself, in which case the
material has only volumetric strength (the material is assumed to have no shear strength). Alternatively,
Abaqus/Explicit allows you to deﬁne deviatoric behavior, assuming that the deviatoric and volumetric responses
are uncoupled. Three options are available for the deviatoric response: a linear isotropic elastic model, a viscous
model, and a nonlinear viscoelastic model. The material's volumetric response is governed then by the equation
of state model, while its deviatoric response is governed by either the linear isotropic elastic model, the viscous
ﬂuid model or the nonlinear viscoelastic model.
Elastic Shear Behavior
For the elastic shear behavior the deviatoric stress is related to the deviatoric strain as
where  is the deviatoric stress and 
 is the deviatoric elastic strain. See Deﬁning Isotropic Shear Elasticity

shear modulus.
In addition to modeling nonlinear viscoelastic shear behavior, you can also use this model to simulate purely
viscous ﬂuids with very large viscosity by carefully choosing a penalty value for the elastic shear modulus, ,
to achieve a reasonable stable time increment. You can combine elastic shear behavior with viscous shear behavior
only; you cannot add any additional plastic shear behavior to the material deﬁnition.

An equation of state model, with the exception of the ignition and growth model, can be used in conjunction

pressure-dependent plasticity behavior. This approach can be appropriate for modeling the response of ceramics
and other brittle materials under high velocity impact conditions. In this case you must deﬁne the elastic part of
the shear behavior. The material's deviatoric response is governed by the linear elastic shear and the
pressure-dependent plasticity model, while the volumetric response is governed by the equation of state model.
In particular, no plastic dilation effects are taken into account (if you specify a dilation angle other than zero,
the value is ignored and Abaqus/Explicit issues a warning message).

Use with the Tensile Failure Model
An equation of state model (except the ideal gas equation of state) can also be used with the tensile failure model
(Dynamic Failure Models) to model dynamic spall or a pressure cutoff. The tensile failure model uses the
hydrostatic pressure stress as a failure measure and offers a number of failure choices. You must provide the
hydrostatic cutoff stress.
You can specify that the deviatoric stresses should fail when the tensile failure criterion is met. In the case where
the material's deviatoric behavior is not deﬁned, this speciﬁcation is meaningless and is, therefore, ignored.
The tensile failure model in Abaqus/Explicit is designed for high-strain-rate dynamic problems in which inertia
effects are important. Therefore, it should be used only for such situations. Improper use of the tensile failure
model may result in an incorrect simulation.

Adiabatic Assumption
An adiabatic condition is always assumed for materials modeled with an equation of state unless a dynamic
coupled temperature-displacement procedure is used. The adiabatic condition is assumed irrespective of whether
an adiabatic dynamic stress analysis step has been speciﬁed. The temperature increase is calculated directly at
the material integration points according to the adiabatic thermal energy increase caused by the mechanical work
where 
 is the speciﬁc heat at constant volume. Specifying temperature as a predeﬁned ﬁeld has no effect on
the behavior of this model.
When performing a fully coupled temperature-displacement analysis, the speciﬁc energy is updated based on
the evolving temperature ﬁeld using
Modeling Fluids
A linear 
 equation of state model can be used to model incompressible viscous and inviscid laminar
ﬂow governed by the Navier-Stokes equation of motion. The volumetric response is governed by the equations
of state, where the bulk modulus acts as a penalty parameter for the incompressible constraint.
To model a viscous laminar ﬂow that follows the Navier-Poisson law of a Newtonian ﬂuid, use the Newtonian
viscous deviatoric model and deﬁne the viscosity as the real linear viscosity of the ﬂuid. To model non-Newtonian
viscous ﬂow, use one of the nonlinear viscosity models available in Abaqus/Explicit. Appropriate initial conditions
for velocity and stress are essential to get an accurate solution for this class of problems.
To model an incompressible inviscid ﬂuid such as water in Abaqus/Explicit, it is useful to deﬁne a small amount
of shear resistance to suppress shear modes that can otherwise tangle the mesh. Here the shear stiffness or shear
Abaqus Materials Guide
582
Equation of State

viscosity acts as a penalty parameter. The shear modulus or viscosity should be small because ﬂow is inviscid;
a high shear modulus or viscosity will result in an overly stiff response. To avoid an overly stiff response, the
internal forces arising due to the deviatoric response of the material should be kept several orders of magnitude
below the forces arising due to the volumetric response. This can be done by choosing an elastic shear modulus
that is several orders of magnitude lower than the bulk modulus. If the viscous model is used, the shear viscosity
speciﬁed should be on the order of the shear modulus, calculated as above, scaled by the stable time increment.
The expected stable time increment can be obtained from a data check analysis of the model. This method is a
convenient way to approximate a shear resistance that will not introduce excessive viscosity in the material.
If a shear model is deﬁned, the hourglass control forces are calculated based on the shear resistance of the
material. Thus, in materials with extremely low or zero shear strengths such as inviscid ﬂuids, the hourglass
forces calculated based on the default parameters are insufﬁcient to prevent spurious hourglass modes. Therefore,
a sufﬁciently high hourglass scaling factor is recommended to increase the resistance to such modes.
Elements
In general, the equations of state can be used with any solid (continuum) elements in Abaqus/Explicit except
plane stress elements. The ignition and growth equation of state cannot be used with plane strain, plane stress,
and axisymmetric elements. For three-dimensional applications exhibiting high conﬁnement, the default kinematic
formulation is recommended with reduced-integration solid elements (see Section Controls).

Multiscale Material Modeling
Overview
The multiscale material model in Abaqus uses the mean-ﬁeld homogenization approach to capture the behavior of
heterogeneous materials that contain a matrix material and one or more inclusion materials.
The goal of multiscale material modeling is to predict material behaviors at the macro-level using information at smaller
scales. The information can be communicated between scales from the bottom up; the microstructure of the composite
material is represented by a Representative Volume Element (RVE), then a homogenization scheme is applied to the
RVE, which provides a prediction of macro-constitutive behavior at a material point, as shown in Figure 1.

RVE

material
Figure 1: Homogenization of a heterogeneous material.
The information can also be communicated from a macro scale down to smaller scales by applying the macro-strain
as a far-ﬁeld strain to the RVE. The state of the constituents on the micro-level, such as strain and stress, are then
updated, and the averaged quantities are communicated back to the material point at the macro-level.
Mean-ﬁeld approaches such as Mori-Tanaka can provide analytical solutions of the averaged stresses and strains in
each constituent of the composite. The averaged strain of each constituent is determined based on the speciﬁc
homogenization method, which is based on assumptions of the interaction between inclusions and the matrix. Since
only volume-averaged quantities are considered, this approach is unable to capture local stress concentration inside
the RVE and the size effects of the inclusions; however, it is computationally efﬁcient compared to the FE-RVE
approach in which the RVE is modeled with a ﬁnite element model.
The mean-ﬁeld homogenization approach gives good predictions for linear elastic composites. Since the homogenization
is performed during the analysis, nonlinear and history-dependent behavior can be captured. However, in the case of
highly nonlinear constituent materials, calibration is usually necessary for better predictions. If experimental results
are not available, the results of an FE-RVE that represent details of the microstructure can be used as an alternative
for calibration.

Specifying Constituent Properties for a Composite Material
In multiscale material modeling, each composite material consists of one matrix material and one or more
inclusions including voids. In Abaqus/Explicit, the composite material must consist of one matrix material and
only one inclusion; the inclusion material must be linear elastic with constant properties, and the matrix material
can be only linear elastic or elastic-plastic with isotropic hardening.

Voigt and Reuss Models
The simplest mean-ﬁeld homogenization formulations are the Voigt and Reuss models. These models do not
take into account the shape or the orientation of the inclusions; however, they provide upper and lower bounds
of the macro stiffness modulus and, therefore, can be used for validation. The Voigt model is also used in a
two-step approach to model composites with multiple inclusions.

Eshelby-Based Models
The more sophisticated mean-ﬁeld homogenizations are based on Eshelby's solution. In his 1957 paper (Eshelby,
1957), Eshelby solved a single-inclusion problem described in Figure 1.
Figure 1: Eshelby's problem: an ellipsoid is cut out of an infinite matrix, undergoes an
eigenstrain, and is inserted back into the matrix.
Eshelby found that the strain inside the constrained ellipsoid is uniform and given by
where  represents a point inside the inclusion and 
 is the eigenstrain. The Eshelby tensor (E) is a function of
the stiffness of the matrix and also the shape and orientation of the inclusion. To calculate Eshelby's tensor
usually involves numerical integration over the surface of the ellipsoidal inclusion; however, analytical solutions
are available (Mura, 1987) for simple shapes such as a sphere, cylinder, penny, oblate, and prolate. Based on
Eshelby's solution, the following models are proposed based on different assumptions about the properties of
the outer material surrounding the inclusions.
Mori-Tanaka Model
The Mori-Tanaka formulation assumes that each inclusion behaves like an isolated inclusion and the strain in
the matrix is considered as the far-ﬁeld strain. Therefore, the concentration tensor can be written as

Conductivity
The effective conductivity of composite materials can also be computed using Eshelby's single-inclusion method
described in Mean-Field Homogenization for Linear Elastic Composites. For example, Mori-Tanaka method
gives the following conductivity concentration tensor
where 
 is the modiﬁed 3x3 second-order Eshelby's tensor and 
 are second-order conductivity tensor of
the constituents.
The relationship between the temperature gradient in the constituents is given by
and the macro-level temperature gradient is the volume-averaged temperature gradient of the constituents. Chamis
and CCA formulations are not supported for conductivity.
Specific Heat and Latent Heat
The speciﬁc heat and latent heat of the composite can be compute using the mass-averaged value of the
constituents.
Incremental Mean-Field Homogenization for Nonlinear Composites
An incremental linearization approach is used to extend the homogenization models to composites with nonlinear
behavior. The tangent stiffness matrix is used in place of the linear elastic modulus to compute the concentration
tensor 
Since the tangent matrix is not constant in the nonlinear case and is usually a function of the strain, iterations
are performed to guarantee a converged solution of the strain increment in each constituent.
Isotropization Methods
Analytical expression of Eshelby's tensor is available only if the inclusions are ellipsoidal and the matrix material
is isotropic or transversely isotropic. For matrix materials that are anisotropic, using the stiffness directly to
compute the Eshelby's tensor can result in stiffer prediction for the composite behavior (Doghri, 2003). The
isotropic part of the tangent stiffness matrix can generally be written as
where 
 is the bulk modulus and  is the shear modulus. 
 and 
 are the volumetric and deviatoric part
of the fourth-order identity tensor. The method used to extract the isotropic part of the stiffness matrix is not
unique, and the accuracy of the prediction varies depending on the properties of the matrix material.
General Method
The general method is the most common isotropization method, and it extracts the isotropic part using

method.

Mean-Field Homogenization

It is possible that some choices can lead to unphysical prediction of microlevel strain resulting in unstable material
behavior in the composite. In addition, in Abaqus/Standard analyses, the tangent stiffness matrix for the composite
might lose its symmetry after homogenization; therefore, you must use the unsymmetric solver to achieve
convergence.

Multistep Homogenization
For composites with multiple inclusions, a multistep homogenization approach is used, as shown in Figure 2.
The composite is decomposed into "grains," with each grain containing one inclusion family and the matrix.
The inclusions in each family have the same material properties, aspect ratio, and orientation. In the ﬁrst step
homogenization is performed in each grain using the user-speciﬁed formulation; in the second step, the Voigt
formulation is used to compute the properties of the overall composite.
An alternative approach is to use the Mori-Tanaka scheme in both the ﬁrst and the second step, assuming the
average strain in the matrix is uniform across all grains. This approach is equivalent to the direct Mori-Tanaka
approach proposed by Benveniste (Benveniste et al., 1991). In an Abaqus/Standard analysis, the second approach
has the drawback that it might result in an unsymmetric effective modulus when the inclusions are misaligned
and nonisotropic. In such cases, use of the unsymmetric solver might be necessary.
Abaqus/Explicit analyses only support one matrix and one inclusion material. For composites with dispersed
ﬁber directions (see Specifying a Second-Order Orientation Tensor in Abaqus/Explicit), the direct Mori-Tanaka
approach is used.

You can specify the microstructure of the composite by giving the shape, volume fraction, aspect ratio, and ﬁber

orientation tensor (see Distribution Deﬁnition).
The orientation tensor and random ﬁber orientation can be used only with three-dimensional solid elements.

coordinate system speciﬁed in the section deﬁnition. You can specify a different orientation by giving the three
components of the orientation vector in the local coordinate system, as shown in Figure 4. The components of
the orientation unit vector, , are
The local 3-direction of the inclusion (void included) is the projection of the local z-axis deﬁned in the section
onto the surface normal to the inclusion orientation (1-direction). If the local z-axis is within 0.1 degree of being
parallel to the 1-direction, the local 3-direction is the projection of the local y-axis onto the surface. The local
2-direction is then at right angles to the local 3-direction, so that the local 2-direction, local 3-direction, and the
inclusion orientation (1-direction) form a right-handed set. The local 2 and 3 directions are relevant only if the
shape of the inclusion (void included) is an elliptical cylinder.

 must be computed during the analysis, and the ODF is required to calculate the integral.
When only the second-order orientation is available, Abaqus recovers the ODF using the approach proposed by
Onat and Leckie (1988)
for three-dimensional orientations, where 
 and 
 are the tensor basis functions
and 
 and 
 are the deviatoric versions of the orientation tensors

Mean-Field Homogenization

The fourth-order orientation tensor is required during the ODF reconstruction. It is computed using a closure
approximation, which is a formula that approximates the fourth-order tensor in terms of the known second-order
tensor. A popular closure approximation is the hybrid closure approximation proposed by Advani and Tucker
(1987), which is constructed using the interpolation of linear and quadratic closure approximation
where the linear closure is given by
and the quadratic closure is given by
The weight function is deﬁned as 
 for three-dimensional orientations.
Other available closure approximations are the orthotropic smooth approximation (Advani and Tucker, 1987),
the orthotropic ﬁtted (ORF) approximation (Cintra and Tucker, 1995), and the orthotropic equivalent of the
natural (ORE) approximation (VerWeyst, 1998).
Only one constituent in the composite is allowed to have orientations speciﬁed with the second-order orientation
tensor.
Taking into account the symmetry of the ODF
, we compute the integral 
 numerically
as follows:
where 
 and 
. The numerical integral is computed by subdividing the
macro point into 
 subdomains, with each subdomain having the same ﬁber orientation 
.
Then a multistep homogenization (as described in Figure 2) is used to compute the macrolevel solutions. The
ODF is more accurately recovered if a large value of N is used; however, the computational cost and memory
usage also increases substantially.
When the ﬁber direction is random in the three-dimensional space, the second-order orientation tensor is
, and the ODF is constant across all subdomains.
When the direct Mori-Tanaka homogenization approach is used, the ﬁber response can be calculated either
individually in each subdomain or just once using the averaged state over all subdomains. In both cases only the
averaged ﬁber state is available for output. The maximum principal direction of the second-order orientation
tensor is used as the 1-direction of the local coordinate system for the inclusion.
In composites where the ﬁber material is linear elastic with uniform moduli across all pseudo-grains, if we
assume uniform matrix strain inside the composite, homogenization and strain partitioning can be simpliﬁed.
Instead of computing the integrals numerically, Abaqus/Standard uses the following equation to compute the
orientation averaging terms, 
:
where 
, 
, 
, 
, and 
 are the ﬁve constants of the tensor that is transversely isotropic. ODF reconstruction
is not necessary and is not performed.

Specifying a Second-Order Orientation Tensor in Abaqus/Explicit
In Abaqus/Explicit, when a second-order orientation tensor, , is used to specify the dispersion of the ﬁber
material, the direct Mori-Tanaka approach is used. Because the ﬁber material can be only linear elastic with
uniform moduli across all pseudo-grains, ODF reconstruction is not performed and orientation averaging terms
are computed directly.
The second-order orientation tensor is speciﬁed in the orientation deﬁnition of the section where the multiscale
material is assigned.

Composites with Thermal Expansion
Composites with thermal expansion are supported only in Abaqus/Standard.
The effective thermal expansion coefﬁcient tensor can be computed using Levin's theorem (2):
where 
 are the thermal expansion coefﬁcients of the constituents, 
 is the total number of inclusions, and
 are the stress concentration tensors deﬁned in Mean-Field Homogenization for Linear Elastic Composites.
In the presence of thermal strains due to a temperature change, the averaged strain/stress in each constituent can
be written as:
The relationship between 
 and 
 can be established through superposition of the two problems to achieve
the condition

which results in the relationship between 
 and 
 below
599
Abaqus Materials Guide
Mean-Field Homogenization

Thermal expansion is supported only for plane strain and three-dimensional solid elements.
Composites with Viscoelasticity
Composites with viscoelasticity are supported only in Abaqus/Standard.
When one or more constituents have viscoelasticity deﬁned in the time domain, the homogenization approach
described above is no longer appropriate because it does not take into account the relaxation of stress with time.
However, similar homogenization can be performed in the frequency domain, and homogenized properties of
the composite in the time domain can be computed using homogenized properties at different frequencies. This
homogenization approach is applicable only when the viscoelasticity in the constituents is deﬁned in the time
domain using a Prony series expansion and includes the following steps:
1. The shear and bulk moduli of all the constituents are transformed to the frequency domain using Fourier
transforms (see details in Prony Series Parameters).
2. The mean-ﬁeld homogenization is performed in the frequency domain the same way as discussed above,
with the exception that the moduli are complex numbers instead of real numbers. The real part of the composite
modulus is the storage modulus, 
, and the imaginary part is the loss modulus, 
.
3. Assuming the time response of the composite can be written in a similar form as that in the constituents
where viscoelasticity is deﬁned using a Prony series expansion
where 
 and 
 is the instantaneous elastic modulus of the composite, the homogenized
storage modulus of the composite, 
, can be written in the frequency domain as follows:
The parameters 
 are selected to be equally spaced numbers on a logarithmic scale in the range 
.
 and 
 are the minimum and maximum frequencies used to deﬁne the viscoelasticity in all constituents.
The parameters 
 are computed through a least-squares curve ﬁt at frequencies 
.
You can only specify the thermorheologically simple temperature effect in the matrix material. The composite
is assumed to inherit the same temperature effect as the matrix material.
Other limitations include:
1. The inverse Mori-Tanaka and balanced homogenization formulations are not supported when you use the
orientation tensor to deﬁne the direction of the inclusion.
2. When you use the orientation tensor to deﬁne the direction of the inclusion, the elasticity speciﬁed in the
inclusion material must satisfy the transversely isotropic condition, and no other inclusions can be deﬁned
in the composite.
3. You cannot use the orientation tensor to deﬁne the direction of the inclusion in which viscoelasticity is
deﬁned.
4. Distributions other than distributions of the orientation tensor are not allowed in the material deﬁnition.
5. Temperature and ﬁeld variable dependencies are allowed to deﬁne the elasticity of the matrix material only,
and only one inclusion is allowed in this case.
6. Other than viscoelasticity, only the following properties are supported in the inclusion material:
a. Conductivity
b. Density
c. Elasticity
d. Thermal expansion
e. Speciﬁc heat

7. Other than viscoelasticity, only the following properties are supported in the matrix material:
a. Conductivity
b. Density
c. Elasticity
d. Thermal expansion
e. Speciﬁc heat
f.
Cure properties
Because the multiscale material is replaced by a composite with prehomogenized properties, the microlevel
output is not available. Other than viscoelasticity, Abaqus/Standard also computes the homogenized values of
all the other supported properties.
Composites Curing
Mean-ﬁeld homogenization can be used to model composite behavior during a curing process (Curing Processes
in Polymers). Similar to composites with viscoelasticity, a multiscale material is replaced by a composite with
prehomogenized properties. The same limitations described in Composites with Viscoelasticity also apply.
The composite inherits the following properties from the matrix material deﬁnition:
•
Cure kinetics
•
Cure max conversion
•
Cure glass transition temperature
Mean-ﬁeld homogenization is used to compute the following cure properties for the composite:
•
Cure heat generation. The speciﬁc heat of the reaction is computed using mass-averaged value of the
constituents.
•
Cure shrinkage. Levin's theorem is used to compute the effective thermal expansion coefﬁcient (Composites
with Thermal Expansion) and to compute the effective cure shrinkage coefﬁcient of the composite.
Composites with Damage
When damage and failure are deﬁned at the constituent level, the damage in each constituent contributes to the
overall damage in an indirect way through stress averaging and strain partitioning. As the stiffness of the
constituent decreases, the strain increment in this constituent is likely to increase based on the formulation of
the homogenization. In reality, the damage behavior of each constituent is likely to interact with each other and
affect the overall damage behavior of the composite; therefore, you might need to specify an additional damage
variable, 
, for the composite. At any time during the analysis, the stress tensor of the composite is given by
where 
, and 
 is the effective stress of the constituent.
You can choose to combine the damage variables, 
, in all constituents to get the overall damage behavior of
the composite. The overall damage variable, 
, can be computed as the maximum of 
:
or you can choose to combine the damage variables in a multiplicative sense:
601
Abaqus Materials Guide
Mean-Field Homogenization

You can also specify 
 using user subroutine UDAMAGEMF. In addition, you can specify a separate damage
variable, 
, for each constituent. This variable is used to account for the additional contribution to the overall
damage behavior due to interaction (for example, a ﬁber material might buckle more easily if cracks start to
develop in the matrix material) as follows:
Use the following option to specify that 
 contributes to 
 in a maximum sense:
Input File Usage:
*MEAN FIELD DAMAGE, DEGRADATION=MAXIMUM
Use the following option to specify that 
 contributes to  in a multiplicative sense:
*MEAN FIELD DAMAGE, DEGRADATION=MULTIPLICATIVE
Use the following option to specify a user-deﬁned damage behavior for the composite:
*MEAN FIELD DAMAGE, DEGRADATION=USER
Abaqus does not support damage and failure deﬁned at the composite level, with the exception of the general
stress/strain-based damage initiation criteria in Abaqus/Standard (see Generalized Damage Initiation Criteria
for Anisotropic Materials). Instead of computing the damage criterion using the composite-level stress/strain
data, Abaqus/Standard evaluates the damage initiation criterion in each pseudo-grain using homogenized
stress/strain, then computes an weighted average at the composite level written as
where  is the averaged damage initiation criterion or failure index, 
 is the damage initiation criterion or
failure index in each pseudo-grain, and 
 is the number of pseudo-grains in the multiscale model. This feature
is not supported when an averaged response of the ﬁber is computed in a chopped ﬁber-reinforced composite,
because the stress/strain data are not available in each pseudo-grain but rather computed as averaged quantities.
Example
This simple example illustrates how to deﬁne a multiscale material.
The name of the multiscale material is COMPOSITE. The material consists of one inclusion material MAT2
embedded in the matrix material MAT1. The shape of the inclusion is prolate. The Mori-Tanaka homogenization
method is used. The inclusion has a volume fraction of 
 and an aspect ratio of 
. The direction of the inclusion
is ﬁxed and deﬁned with a vector 
. The name of the matrix is MATRIX_MAT1, and the name of the
inclusion is FIBER_MAT2.

Elements
In Abaqus/Standard the multiscale material model can be used with
•
three-dimensional solid elements, including stress/displacement elements, diffusive heat transfer elements,
and coupled temperature-displacement elements;
•
two-dimensional solid elements (stress/displacement only);
•
membrane elements;
•
three-dimensional conventional shell elements (stress/displacement only); and
•
continuum shell elements (stress/displacement only).
In Abaqus/Standard additional plane stress iterations are included for two-dimensional plane stress elements and
shell elements.
In Abaqus/Explicit the multiscale material model can be used only with three-dimensional solid stress/displacement
elements.
Hybrid elements and incompatible mode elements are not supported.
Output
By default, the output variables are macrolevel results. In addition, you can also request microlevel output. The
name of the constituent is appended to the end of the output variable.
For composites reinforced with dispersed short ﬁbers, the ﬁber output variables are computed in the local system
with the local ﬁber direction as the maximum principal direction of the orientation tensor. The matrix output is
available only if the direct Mori-Tanaka homogenization approach is used. Otherwise, only averaged stress and
strain are available. If plasticity is speciﬁed in the matrix material, averaged plastic strains are also available.
The same matrix output limitation also applies to composites reinforced with multiple ﬁber families.
Microlevel strain output is not available in Abaqus/Explicit.
Use the following options to request ﬁeld output for the constituents:

*ELEMENT OUTPUT, MICROMECHANICS

Overview
A linear elastic fatigue crack growth criterion can be used to:
•
model propagation of a discrete crack in a brittle material along an arbitrary, solution-dependent path, without any
remeshing, and using the extended ﬁnite element method (XFEM); and
•
model progressive delamination growth along a predeﬁned path at brittle material interfaces in laminated composites.
Linear Elastic Fatigue Crack Growth Behaviors
The onset and fatigue crack growth are both characterized by means of the Paris law, which relates either the
onset or the rate of growth of a fatigue crack to the relative fracture energy release rate, as illustrated in Figure
1. The Paris law can also be expressed in terms of the equivalent relative stress intensity factor in some cases.
An alternative form to the original Paris law, which better accounts for the mixed mode fatigue crack growth,
and that depends on the maximum energy release rate (instead of the relative value) is also available. The
alternative form is illustrated in Figure 2. The detailed equations for the different forms of the Paris law that are
available in Abaqus are described later in this section.
The Paris regime is bounded by lower and upper limits, 
 and 
, respectively. The lower limit represents
the energy release rate threshold, 
 (or the equivalent stress intensity factor threshold, 
), below
which there is no consideration of fatigue crack initiation or growth. The upper limit, 
 (or the equivalent
stress intensity factor limit, 
) , represents the energy release rate above which the fatigue crack grows at an
accelerated rate. You can specify the ratio of 
 and the ratio of 
 to deﬁne the lower and upper limits of
the Paris regime. The quantity 
 in these ratios represents the critical equivalent strain energy release rate,
calculated based on the pure mode fracture strengths of the bulk material and the user-speciﬁed mode-mix
criterion. The default values of these bounds are 
 and 
, respectively.

Mixed-Mode Behavior
Abaqus provides three common mode-mix formulas for computing the equivalent fracture energy release rate,
: the BK law, the power law, and the Reeder law. The choice of model is not always clear in any given
analysis; an appropriate model is best selected empirically.
BK Law
The BK law in Abaqus follows Benzeggagh and Kenane (1996) and is described by the following formula:
To deﬁne this model, you must provide 
 and . This model provides a power law relationship
combining the energy release rates in Mode I, Mode II, and Mode III into a single scalar fracture criterion.

Abaqus/CAE Usage:
Onset of Fatigue Crack Growth
The onset of fatigue crack growth is characterized by 
, which is the relative fracture energy release rate when
the structure is loaded between its maximum and minimum values. The fatigue crack growth initiation criterion
is deﬁned as
where 
 and 
 are assumed to be material constants and 
 is the cycle number for onset. The crack front is
not propagated unless the above equation is satisﬁed, and the maximum fracture energy release rate, 
 (which
corresponds to the cyclic energy release rate when the structure is loaded up to its maximum value) is greater
than 
. If you do not specify the onset criterion, Abaqus/Standard assumes that the onset of fatigue crack
growth is satisﬁed automatically.
Fatigue Crack Growth Using the Paris Law
Once the onset criterion is satisﬁed at nodes along the crack front, the crack growth rate, 
, can be calculated
based on the relative fracture energy release rate, 
. If 
, the rate of crack growth per
cycle is given by the Paris law:
where 
 and 
 are assumed to be material constants.
Ratcliffe and Johnston (2014) and Deobald et al. (2017) proposed the following alternate form of the fatigue
law, which better accounts for mixed-mode fatigue crack growth:
In the above expression, 
 is the total maximum strain energy release rate as opposed to the strain energy
release rate range over a cycle, and the Paris law parameters, 
 and 
 are assumed to be material parameters
that depend on mode-mix and stress ratios. Abaqus does not support the above form of the crack growth rate
equation directly; instead, it allows you to specify 
 as a tabular function of 
, the mode-mix ratio,
and the stress ratio.
In addition, you can utilize user subroutine UMIXMODEFATIGUE to implement a user-deﬁned fatigue crack
growth law.
For linear elastic materials, the fracture energy release rate is directly related to the stress intensity factors by
the following relationship:
Abaqus Materials Guide
610
Fatigue Crack Growth Laws for Linear Elastic Materials

where 
 is the Young's modulus (which is equal to 
under plane strain and full three-dimensional conditions),
 is the shear modulus, and  is the Poisson's ratio. A form based on the stress intensity factor, 
 that is equivalent
to the fracture energy release rate–based form above, is also available:
where 
 and 
 are assumed to be material constants, and 
 is the effective stress intensity factor range
of a load cycle.
Abaqus uses the Irwin (1968) deﬁnition of an effective stress intensity factor that is applicable under mixed-mode
conditions and is given by:
where A, B, and C are user-deﬁned material constants.
For the fatigue crack growth criterion, the following forms based on the stress intensity factor are also available:
•
A tabular form to support multiple piecewise linear log-log (
 versus 
) segments.
•
A user-deﬁned crack growth criterion using user subroutine UMIXMODEFATIGUE.

Elements
In general, any of the stress/displacement elements in Abaqus/Standard can be used in a fatigue crack growth
analysis (see Choosing the Appropriate Element for an Analysis Type). However, when modeling fatigue crack
growth with the extended ﬁnite element method based on the principles of linear elastic fracture mechanics, only
ﬁrst-order continuum stress/displacement elements and second-order stress/displacement tetrahedral elements
can be associated with an enriched feature (see Modeling Discontinuities as an Enriched Feature Using the
Extended Finite Element Method).
Output Variables
In addition to the standard output identiﬁers available in Abaqus/Standard (see Abaqus/Standard Output Variable
Identiﬁers), whole element and surface variables are available.
The following whole element variables are available with the extended ﬁnite element method:

element.

Overview
Material damping can be deﬁned:
•
for direct-integration (nonlinear, implicit, or explicit), subspace-based direct-integration, direct-solution steady-state,
and subspace-based steady-state dynamic analysis; or
•
for mode-based (linear) dynamic analysis in Abaqus/Standard.
Rayleigh Damping
In direct-integration dynamic analysis you very often deﬁne energy dissipation mechanisms—dashpots, inelastic
material behavior, etc.—as part of the basic model. In such cases there is usually no need to introduce additional
damping: it is often unimportant compared to these other dissipative effects. However, some models do not have
such dissipation sources (an example is a linear system with chattering contact, such as a pipeline in a seismic
event). In such cases it is often desirable to introduce some general damping. Abaqus provides “Rayleigh”
damping for this purpose. It provides a convenient abstraction to damp lower (mass-dependent) and higher
(stiffness-dependent) frequency range behavior.
Rayleigh damping can also be used in direct-solution steady-state dynamic analyses and subspace-based
steady-state dynamic analyses to get quantitatively accurate results, especially near natural frequencies.
To deﬁne material Rayleigh damping, you specify two Rayleigh damping factors: 
 for mass proportional
damping and 
 for stiffness proportional damping. In general, damping is a material property speciﬁed as part
of the material deﬁnition. For the cases of rotary inertia, point mass elements, and substructures, where there is
no reference to a material deﬁnition, the damping can be deﬁned in conjunction with the property references.
Any mass proportional damping also applies to nonstructural features (see Nonstructural Mass Deﬁnition).
For a given mode i the fraction of critical damping, , can be expressed in terms of the damping factors 
 and
 as:
where 
 is the natural frequency at this mode. This equation implies that, generally speaking, the mass
proportional Rayleigh damping, 
, damps the lower frequencies and the stiffness proportional Rayleigh damping,
, damps the higher frequencies.

Material Damping

Mass Proportional Damping
The 
 factor introduces damping forces caused by the absolute velocities of the model and so simulates the
idea of the model moving through a viscous “ether” (a permeating, still ﬂuid, so that any motion of any point in
the model causes damping). This damping factor deﬁnes mass proportional damping, in the sense that it gives
a damping contribution proportional to the mass matrix for an element. If the element contains more than one
material in Abaqus/Standard, the volume average value of 
 is used to multiply the element's mass matrix to
deﬁne the damping contribution from this term. If the element contains more than one material in Abaqus/Explicit,
the mass average value of 
 is used to multiply the element's lumped mass matrix to deﬁne the damping
contribution from this term.

The

 deﬁnes damping proportional to the elastic material stiffness. Since the model may
have quite general nonlinear response, the concept of “stiffness proportional damping” must be generalized,
since it is possible for the tangent stiffness matrix to have negative eigenvalues (which would imply negative
damping). To overcome this problem, 
 is interpreted as deﬁning viscous material damping in Abaqus, which
creates an additional “damping stress,” 
, proportional to the total strain rate:

 will be calculated based on the
current temperature during the analysis.
This damping stress is added to the stress caused by the constitutive response at the integration point when the
dynamic equilibrium equations are formed, but it is not included in the stress output. As a result, damping can
be introduced for any nonlinear case and provides standard Rayleigh damping for linear cases; for a linear case
stiffness proportional damping is exactly the same as deﬁning a damping matrix equal to 
 times the (elastic)
material stiffness matrix. Other contributions to the stiffness matrix (for example, hourglass, transverse shear,
and drill stiffnesses) are not included when computing stiffness proportional damping.

Band-Limited Damping
For stiffness proportional damping, the fraction of critical damping is linearly proportional to the response
frequency. Therefore, the desired damping ratio is achieved only at one target frequency. For practical purposes,
it is useful to deﬁne the desired damping ratio uniformly over a reasonable frequency range. Band-limited
damping provides this capability. It is available in Abaqus/Explicit and in Abaqus/Standard in implicit dynamic
analysis.
Unlike stiffness proportional damping, which creates an additional damping stress proportional to the total strain
rate, band-limited damping creates an additional damping stress, 
. This additional damping stress is proportional
to the rate of ﬁltered constitutive stress at the integration point:
where
is the actual damping ratio calculated based on the desired damping ratio and the frequency range,
is the stress caused by the constitutive response at the integration point, and
is the rate of linear transform 
, which is the low-pass ﬁlter operator.
The frequency range is deﬁned by the low-frequency cutoff, 
, and the high-frequency cutoff, 
. The actual
damping ratio varies with frequency and achieves the desired damping ratio only within the frequency range.
Outside the frequency range, the damping ratio is not exactly zero. The accuracy to achieve the desired damping
ratio depends on the ratio of the high-frequency cutoff to the low-frequency cutoff, 
.
For example, if the desired damping ratio is 
, the normalized damping ratio is 
. Figure 1 shows the
normalized damping ratio as a function of frequency for two cases: the red dotted line for the range

It is well known that band-limited damping has a signiﬁcant impact on the dynamic stiffness of the structure.
The changes in the dynamic stiffness of the structure depend on the damping ratio and the frequency range. It
increases the natural frequency of each mode, and the percentage change of the damped frequency could be
large. For example, if 
, the maximum percentage change of the damped frequency to the natural
frequency could reach approximately 1.65% (increased) with 
. Compared to stiffness proportional
damping, the percentage change of the damped frequency is only 0.02% (reduced). For the ﬁxed 
, this
percentage change is approximately linearly proportional to the damping ratio. Therefore, in practical applications,
it is recommended that you use a low value for the damping ratio.
Similar to stiffness proportional damping, the band-limited damping stress is added to the stress caused by the
constitutive response at the integration point when the dynamic equilibrium equations are formed, but it is not
included in the stress output.

contribution of band-limited damping, as mentioned above. For a material subjected to a harmonic excitation,
the output of viscous energy dissipation can show an oscillatory behavior, with oscillation that is more pronounced
at higher frequencies. An accurate value of the energy dissipated per cycle can be obtained by subtracting the
value at the beginning of the cycle from the value at the end of the cycle.
Structural Damping
Structural damping assumes that the damping forces are proportional to the forces caused by stressing of the
structure and are opposed to the velocity. Therefore, this form of damping can be used only when the displacement
and velocity are exactly 90° out of phase. Structural damping is best suited for frequency domain dynamic
procedures (see Damping in Modal Superposition Procedures below). The damping forces are then
where 
 are the damping forces, 
, s is the user-deﬁned structural damping factor, and 
 are the
forces caused by stressing of the structure. The damping forces due to structural damping are intended to represent
frictional effects (as distinct from viscous effects). Thus, structural damping is suggested for models involving
materials that exhibit frictional behavior or where local frictional effects are present throughout the model, such
as dry rubbing of joints in a multi-link structure.
Structural damping can be added to the model as mechanical dampers such as connector damping or as a complex
stiffness on spring elements.
Structural damping can be used in steady-state dynamic procedures that allow for nondiagonal damping.

Artificial Damping in Direct-Integration Dynamic Analysis
In Abaqus/Standard the operators used for implicit direct time integration introduce some artiﬁcial damping in
addition to Rayleigh damping. Damping associated with the Hilber-Hughes-Taylor and hybrid operators is
usually controlled by the Hilber-Hughes-Taylor parameter , which is not the same as the 
 parameter controlling
the mass proportional part of Rayleigh damping. The  and  parameters of the Hilber-Hughes-Taylor and hybrid
operators also affect numerical damping. The , , and  parameters are not available for the backward Euler
operator. See Implicit Dynamic Analysis Using Direct Integration for more information about this other form
of damping.

Material Damping

Artificial Damping in Explicit Dynamic Analysis
Rayleigh damping is meant to reﬂect physical damping in the actual material. In Abaqus/Explicit a small amount
of numerical damping is introduced by default in the form of bulk viscosity to control high frequency oscillations;
see Explicit Dynamic Analysis for more information about this other form of damping.
Effects of Damping on the Stable Time Increment in Abaqus/Explicit
As the fraction of critical damping for the highest mode (
) increases, the stable time increment for
Abaqus/Explicit decreases according to the equation
where (by substituting 
, the frequency of the highest mode, into the equation for  given previously)
These equations indicate a tendency for stiffness proportional damping to have a greater effect on the stable time
increment than mass proportional damping.
To illustrate the effect that damping has on the stable time increment, consider a cantilever in bending modeled
with continuum elements. The lowest frequency is 
 1 rad/sec, while for the particular mesh chosen, the
highest frequency is 
 1000 rad/sec. The lowest mode in this problem corresponds to the cantilever in
bending, and the highest frequency is related to the dilation of a single element.
With no damping the stable time increment is
If we use stiffness proportional damping to create 1% of critical damping in the lowest mode, the damping factor
is given by
This corresponds to a critical damping factor in the highest mode of
The stable time increment with damping is, thus, reduced by a factor of
and becomes
Thus, introducing 1% critical damping in the lowest mode reduces the stable time increment by a factor of twenty.
However, if we use mass proportional damping to damp out the lowest mode with 1% of critical damping, the
damping factor is given by
which corresponds to a critical damping factor in the highest mode of
619
Abaqus Materials Guide
Material Damping

The stable time increment with damping is reduced by a factor of
which is almost negligible.
This example demonstrates that it is generally preferable to damp out low-frequency response with mass
proportional damping rather than stiffness proportional damping. However, mass proportional damping can
signiﬁcantly affect rigid body motion, so large 
 is often undesirable. To avoid a dramatic drop in the stable
time increment, the stiffness proportional damping factor, 
, should be less than or of the same order of
magnitude as the initial stable time increment without damping. With 
, the stable time increment
is reduced by about 52%.
The above equation to calculate the stable time increment with critical damping is not suitable for band-limited
damping. Because band-limited damping affects the dynamic stiffness of the structure, the stable time increment
could have a dramatic drop if the damping ratio, 
, or the ratio of high-frequency cutoff to low-frequency cutoff,
, is large. Figure 2 illustrates the scale factor for the stable time increment with band-limited damping.
The red dotted line shows the scale factor as a function of 
 with 
, and the blue solid line shows
the scale factor as a function of 
 with

scale factor is 0.9801 when 
 and is 0.9049 when

Damping in Modal Superposition Procedures
Damping can be speciﬁed as part of the step deﬁnition for modal superposition procedures. Damping in a Linear
Dynamic Analysis describes the availability of damping types, which depends on the procedure type and the
architecture used to perform the analysis, and provides details on the following types of damping:
•
Viscous modal damping (Rayleigh damping and fraction of critical damping)
•
Structural modal damping
•
Composite modal damping
Abaqus Materials Guide

Material Damping

Material Options
The 
 factor applies to all elements that use a linear elastic material deﬁnition (Linear Elastic Behavior) and
to Abaqus/Standard beam and shell elements that use general sections. In the latter case, if a nonlinear beam
section deﬁnition is provided, the 
 factor is multiplied by the slope of the force-strain (or moment-curvature)
relationship at zero strain or curvature. In the case of equation of state materials, the 
 factor can apply only
to elements that use a tabulated equation of state material deﬁnition, a linear 
 equation of state material
deﬁnition, or a 
 equation of state material deﬁnition. In addition, the 
 factor applies to all Abaqus/Explicit
elements that use a hyperelastic material deﬁnition (Hyperelastic Behavior of Rubberlike Materials), a hyperfoam
material deﬁnition (Hyperelastic Behavior in Elastomeric Foams), or general shell sections (Using a General
Shell Section to Deﬁne the Section Behavior).
In the case of a no tension elastic material the 
 factor is not used in tension, while for a no compression elastic
material the 
 factor is not used in compression (see No Compression or No Tension). In other words, these
modiﬁed elasticity models exhibit damping only when they have stiffness.
Elements
The 
 factor is applied to all elements that have mass including point mass elements (discrete DASHPOTA
elements in each global direction, each with one node ﬁxed, can also be used to introduce this type of damping).
For point mass and rotary inertia elements mass proportional or composite modal damping are deﬁned as part
of the point mass or rotary inertia deﬁnitions (Point Masses and Rotary Inertia).
The 
 factor is not available for spring elements: discrete dashpot elements should be used in parallel with
spring elements instead.
The 
 factor is also not applied to the transverse shear terms in Abaqus/Standard beams and shells.
The hybrid element stiffness matrix formulation is different than the corresponding non-hybrid formulation;
therefore, the stiffness proportional damping is different for the same value of the 
 factor in nonlinear dynamic
analysis. In linear analyses Abaqus/Standard imposes equivalent stiffness proportional damping for hybrid and
non-hybrid elements.
In Abaqus/Standard composite modal damping cannot be used with or within substructures. Rayleigh damping
can be introduced for substructures. When Rayleigh damping is used within a substructure, 
 and 
 are
averaged over the substructure to deﬁne single values of 
 and 
 for the substructure. These are weighted
averages, using the mass as the weighting factor for 
 and the volume as the weighting factor for 
. These
averaged damping values can be superseded by providing them directly in a second damping deﬁnition. See
Using Substructures.

Defining Thermal Expansion Coefficients
Thermal expansion is a material property included in a material deﬁnition (see Material Data Deﬁnition) except
when it refers to the expansion of a gasket whose material properties are not deﬁned as part of a material deﬁnition.
In that case expansion must be used with the gasket behavior deﬁnition (see Deﬁning the Gasket Behavior
Directly Using a Gasket Behavior Model).
In an Abaqus/Standard analysis a spatially varying thermal expansion can be deﬁned for homogeneous solid
continuum elements by using a distribution (Distribution Deﬁnition). The distribution must include default values
for the thermal expansion. If a distribution is used, no dependencies on temperature and/or ﬁeld variables for
the thermal expansion can be deﬁned.

Tangent Thermal Expansion in Abaqus/Standard
Abaqus/Standard also supports the deﬁnition of thermal expansion coefﬁcients in tangent form. This capability
is particularly useful in situations when a material undergoes curing or similar irreversible transformations and
the thermal expansion coefﬁcient depends on the degree of transformation. Such processes are usually described
using a differential (or tangent) form of thermal expansion that cannot be generally expressed in total (or secant)
form because of the irreversible nature of the transformation.
The tangent coefﬁcient of thermal expansion, 
, is the slope of the expansion curve at a given temperature (see
Figure 1). If the tangent coefﬁcient is speciﬁed, the increment of the thermal strain is computed from
and the thermal strain, 
, is obtained by integrating the above equation from the initial to the current temperature.
Because of the incremental nature of the formulation, the resulting thermal strains generally depend on the
temperature and ﬁeld variable history and might be sensitive to the time increment size (small time increments
are preferred). Therefore, the general recommendation is to use the total (secant) form except for the special
situations of irreversible processes where the tangent formulation can be more suitable to describe the evolution
of thermal strains.

Converting Thermal Expansion Coefficients from Differential Form to Total Form
As discussed earlier, except for materials undergoing irreversible processes, the general recommendation is to
use the total form deﬁnition of thermal expansion because it leads to thermal strain results that are not dependent
on the temperature and ﬁeld variable history or sensitive to the time increment size. In addition, the total form
is the only option available in Abaqus/Explicit. Therefore, it is sometimes necessary to convert the thermal
expansion coefﬁcients from the differential (tangent) to the total (secant) form. This conversion is always possible
when the thermal expansion coefﬁcients are only a function of temperature (no ﬁeld variable dependency).
The temperature dependent tangent thermal expansion data has the form:
that is, the tangent to the strain-temperature curve is provided (see Figure 1). To convert to the secant thermal
expansion form required by Abaqus, this relationship must be integrated from a suitably chosen reference
temperature, 
:
For example, suppose 
 is a series of constant values: 
 between 
 and 
; 
 between 
 and 
; 
 between

The corresponding total expansion coefﬁcients required by Abaqus are then obtained as

During a linear perturbation step, temperature perturbations can produce perturbations of thermal strains in the
form:
where

coefﬁcients are speciﬁed, Abaqus computes the tangent thermal expansion coefﬁcients from the total form as

Thermal Expansion

In an Abaqus/Standard analysis if a distribution is used to deﬁne the thermal expansion, the number of expansion
coefﬁcients given for each element in the distribution, which is determined by the associated distribution table
(Distribution Deﬁnition), must be consistent with the level of anisotropy speciﬁed for the expansion behavior.
For example, if orthotropic behavior is speciﬁed, three expansion coefﬁcients must be deﬁned for each element
in the distribution.

Defining Thermal Expansion for a Short-Fiber Reinforced Composite
The thermal expansion coefﬁcient of a short-ﬁber reinforced composite (for example, an injection molded
composite) can be computed using the orientation averaging described by Zheng (2011):
where 
 is the orientation-averaged elasticity matrix computed using the elasticity of the unidirectional
(UD) composite and the second-order orientation tensor (see Deﬁning the Elasticity of a Short-Fiber Reinforced
Composite), and

where 
 and 
 are the elasticity matrix and thermal expansion coefﬁcient of the unidirectional composite
with the 1-direction as the ﬁber direction, 
 is the second-order orientation tensor, and 
 is the Kronecker

the material directions with local orientations (see Orientations), and the axes of the local system must align
with the principal directions of the second-order orientation tensor.

Thermal Stress
When a structure is not free to expand, a change in temperature will cause stress. For example, consider a single
two-node truss of length L that is completely restrained at both ends. The cross-sectional area; the Young's
modulus, E; and the thermal expansion coefﬁcient, , are all constant. The stress in this one-dimensional problem
can then be calculated from Hooke's Law as 
, where 
 is the total strain and 
 is
the thermal strain, where 
 is the temperature change. Since the element is fully restrained, 
. If the
temperature at both nodes is the same, we obtain the stress 
.
Constrained thermal expansion can cause signiﬁcant stress. For typical structural metals, temperature changes
of about 150°C (300°F) can cause yield. Therefore, it is often important to deﬁne boundary conditions with
particular care for problems involving thermal loading to avoid overconstraining the thermal expansion.
Energy Balance Considerations
Abaqus does not account for thermal expansion effects in the total energy balance equation, which can lead to
an apparent imbalance of the total energy of the model. For example, in the example above of a two-node truss
restrained at both ends, constrained thermal expansion introduces strain energy that will result in an equivalent
increase in the total energy of the model.
Material Options
Thermal expansion can be combined with any other (mechanical) material (see Combining Material Behaviors)
behavior in Abaqus.
Using Thermal Expansion with Other Material Models
For most materials, thermal expansion is deﬁned by a single coefﬁcient or set of orthotropic or anisotropic
coefﬁcients or by deﬁning the incremental thermal strains in user subroutine UEXPAN in Abaqus/Standard and
VUEXPAN in Abaqus/Explicit. For porous media such as soils or rock, you can deﬁne thermal expansion for
the solid grains and for the permeating ﬂuid (when using either the coupled pore ﬂuid diffusion/stress procedure
in Abaqus/Standard or Abaqus/Explicit for the solid grains and for the permeating ﬂuid using either the coupled
pore ﬂuid diffusion/stress procedure—see Coupled Pore Fluid Diffusion and Stress Analysis—or undrained pore
ﬂuid ﬂow and stress analysis in Abaqus/Explicit—see Undrained Pore Fluid Flow and Stress Analysis ). In such
cases, you should repeat the thermal expansion deﬁnition to deﬁne the different thermal expansion effects.
Using Thermal Expansion with Gasket Behaviors
Thermal expansion can be used with any gasket behavior deﬁnition. Thermal expansion will affect the expansion
of the gasket in the membrane direction and/or the expansion in the gasket's thickness direction.

Thermal expansion can be used with any stress/displacement or ﬂuid element in Abaqus.

Field expansion is a material property included in a material deﬁnition (see Material Data Deﬁnition) except
when it refers to the expansion of a gasket whose material properties are not deﬁned as part of a material deﬁnition.

Depending on the value of the ﬁeld expansion coefﬁcient and the change in the value of the corresponding
predeﬁned ﬁeld variable, a constrained ﬁeld expansion can cause signiﬁcant stress and introduce strain energy
that will result in an equivalent increase in the total energy of the model. Therefore, it is often important to deﬁne
boundary conditions with particular care for problems involving this property to avoid overconstraining the ﬁeld
expansion.

Overview
Pore ﬂuid pressure:
•
allows the inclusion of the effects of a known pore ﬂuid pressure ﬁeld in a stress analysis by associating the known
pore ﬂuid pressure ﬁeld with a predeﬁned ﬁeld variable in Abaqus; and
•
can be used in a static or in an explicit dynamic stress analysis.
Defining Pore Fluid Pressure
In geotechnical applications a porous medium typically consists of a solid skeleton of numerous solid grains
that are “loosely packed” and a pore ﬂuid that ﬂows through a system of interconnected pores among these solid
grains. When subjected to loading, both the solid skeleton and the pore ﬂuid respond in a manner that leads
generally to a fully coupled response where the deformation in the solid skeleton depends on the pressure of the
pore ﬂuid and vice versa. Abaqus/Standard supports analysis of such a porous medium through a fully coupled
pore pressure–displacement analysis (see Coupled Pore Fluid Diffusion and Stress Analysis).
In some situations you can approximate the two-way coupling using a sequentially coupled approach that consists
of the following two parts:
1. A purely pore ﬂuid ﬂow analysis that computes the pore ﬂuid pressure distribution in the porous medium
without accounting for the deformation in the solid skeleton. Typically, third-party software is used to
complete this part (outside of Abaqus).
2. A pure stress analysis that computes only the deformation of the solid skeleton, taking into account the effects
of the pore ﬂuid pressure ﬁeld computed in the ﬁrst part. Typically, a static or explicit dynamic analysis in
Abaqus is used to complete this part.
The pore ﬂuid pressure deﬁnition allows the inclusion of a known pore ﬂuid pressure ﬁeld as a predeﬁned ﬁeld
variable in Abaqus in the second part of the sequential workﬂow above (see Predeﬁned Fields for Sequential
Coupling). The material constitutive response in the stress analysis is deﬁned in terms of:
•
the behavior of the solid skeleton, which can utilize any of the mechanical constitutive models available in
Abaqus, and
•
the known pore ﬂuid pressure ﬁeld computed in the ﬁrst part of the sequential analysis and included in the
second part as a predeﬁned ﬁeld variable.
The pore ﬂuid pressure, 
, contributes to the total stress as
In the above expression  is the total stress, and 
 is the effective stress that is a function of the effective strain
and the constitutive response of the solid skeleton (see Effective stress principle for porous media). A static
stress analysis in Abaqus/Standard can account for the compressibility of the solid grains (see Porous Bulk

Viscous Shear Behavior
The resistance to ﬂow of a viscous ﬂuid is described by the following relationship between deviatoric stress and
strain rate
where  is the deviatoric stress,  is the deviatoric part of the strain rate,  is the viscosity, and 
 is the
engineering shear strain rate.
Newtonian ﬂuids are characterized by a viscosity that only depends on temperature,

we have:
Non-Newtonian ﬂuids can be classiﬁed as shear-thinning (or pseudoplastic), when the apparent viscosity decreases
with increasing shear rate, and shear-thickening (or dilatant), when the viscosity increases with strain rate.

CZone Crush Stress
The crush stress can be thought of as the stress of the crushing body at the crushing interface. The crush stress
is speciﬁed as a material property but actually does not directly inﬂuence the constitutive calculations associated
with element integration points; rather, the crush stress limits the contact pressure magnitude at an actively
crushing interface as discussed in CZone Analysis.
The crush stress in the composite material can be a constant or can vary as a function of the angle,  between
the local x-direction of the crushable element and the contact normal direction projected to the plane of the
element.

The crush stress in the composite material can vary as a function of a predeﬁned ﬁeld variable. This ﬁeld variable

assumes that curvature information is deﬁned by the second ﬁeld variable (FV2),
which has been initialized with a value of one at the nodes in the curved regions of
the model and a value of zero in the ﬂat regions. Field variable dependency is
evaluated only at the beginning of the analysis. Subsequent changes in the ﬁeld
variable will have no effect on the crush stress of the material.

About Thermal Properties
Overview
Thermal behavior of a material can be used in heat transfer and thermal stress analyses.
The following properties describe the thermal behavior of a material and can be used in heat transfer and thermal stress
analyses (see About Heat Transfer Analysis Procedures):
Thermal conductivity
When heat ﬂows by conduction, the thermal conductivity must be deﬁned (Conductivity).
Specific heat
In transient heat transfer analyses as well as adiabatic stress analyses the speciﬁc heat of a material must be
deﬁned (Speciﬁc Heat).
Latent heat
When a material changes phase, the change in internal energy can be signiﬁcant. The amount of energy liberated
or absorbed can be deﬁned by specifying a latent heat for each phase change a material undergoes (Latent Heat).

Overview
A material's thermal conductivity:
•
must be deﬁned for Uncoupled Heat Transfer Analysis, Fully Coupled Thermal-Stress Analysis, and Coupled

Isotropic, orthotropic, or fully anisotropic thermal conductivity can be deﬁned. Only isotropic thermal conductivity
can be deﬁned for an incompressible ﬂuid dynamic analysis that includes an energy equation. For orthotropic
or anisotropic thermal conductivity, a local orientation (Orientations) must be used to specify the material
directions used to deﬁne the conductivity.

• Deﬁning speciﬁc heat
Overview
A material's speciﬁc heat:
•
is required for transient Uncoupled Heat Transfer Analysis, transient Fully Coupled Thermal-Stress Analysis,
transient Coupled Thermal-Electrical Analysis, and Adiabatic Analysis;
•
must appear in conjunction with a density deﬁnition (see Density);
•
can be linear or nonlinear (by deﬁning it as a function of temperature); and
•
can be speciﬁed as a function of temperature and/or ﬁeld variables.
Defining Specific Heat
The speciﬁc heat of a substance is deﬁned as the amount of heat required to increase the temperature of a unit
mass by one degree. Mathematically, this physical statement can be expressed as:
where 
 is the inﬁnitessimal heat added per unit mass and  is the entropy per unit mass. Since heat transfer
depends on the conditions encountered during the whole process (a path function), it is necessary to specify the
conditions used in the process to unambiguously characterize the speciﬁc heat. Thus, a process where the heat
is supplied keeping the volume constant deﬁnes the speciﬁc heat as:
where  is the internal energy per unit mass.
Whereas, a process where the heat is supplied keeping the pressure constant deﬁnes the speciﬁc heat as:
where 
 is the enthalpy per unit mass. In general, the speciﬁc heats are functions of temperature. For
solids and liquids, 
 and 
 are equivalent; thus, there is no need to distinguish between them. When possible,
large changes in internal energy or enthalpy during a phase change should be modeled using Latent Heat instead
of speciﬁc heat.

The speciﬁc heat per unit mass is given as a function of temperature and ﬁeld variables. By default, speciﬁc heat
at constant volume is assumed.

Overview
A material's latent heat:
•
models large changes in internal energy during phase change of a material;
•
is active only during transient heat transfer, coupled thermal-stress, coupled thermal-electrical-structural and coupled
thermal-electrical analysis in Abaqus (see About Heat Transfer Analysis Procedures);
•
must appear in conjunction with a density deﬁnition (see Density); and
•
always makes an analysis nonlinear.
Defining Latent Heat
Latent heat effects can be signiﬁcant and must be included in many heat transfer problems involving phase
change. When latent heat is given, it is assumed to be in addition to the speciﬁc heat effect (see Uncoupled heat
transfer analysis for details).
The latent heat is assumed to be released over a range of temperatures from a lower (solidus) temperature to an
upper (liquidus) temperature. To model a pure material with a single phase change temperature, these limits can
be made very close.
As many latent heats as are necessary can be deﬁned to model several phase changes in the material. Latent heat
can be combined with any other material behavior in Abaqus, but it should not be included in the material
deﬁnition unless necessary; it always makes the analysis nonlinear.
Direct Data Specification
If the phase change occurs within a known temperature range, the solidus and liquidus temperatures can be given
directly. The latent heat should be given per unit mass.

Overview
The cure modeling capabilities:
•
are intended to model the curing process in adhesives and other thermosetting polymer materials;
•
predict the degree of cure, volumetric heat generation, and shrinkage strain due to curing reactions;
•
allow you to specify a maximum value of the degree of cure;
•
are active in transient procedures that use elements with displacement degrees of freedom, in the transient heat
transfer procedure, and in the transient coupled thermal-electrical procedure; and
•
are intended for use with existing elastic and viscoelastic behaviors that describe the mechanical response of the
material as a function of the degree of cure.
The cure modeling capabilities described in this section are based on dedicated cure modeling options and output
variables. These capabilities are more general and are intended to supersede those available as a special-purpose material
modeling capability based on built-in user-deﬁned material options (Modeling the Cure Process in Thermosetting
Polymers).
Modeling Curing Processes
Curing processes are essential to the manufacturing of products that use thermosetting polymers (such as epoxy
resins) to bond components. The use of epoxies and other cured structural adhesives is common in many industries.
As a result of the curing reaction, chemical shrinkage strains and residual stresses develop, which can result in
damage to the adherents or warpage of the bonded assembly. The Abaqus cure modeling capability enables you
to analyze curing processes, including the reaction kinetics, heat generation, shrinkage strain development, and
the evolution of mechanical properties. The model is based on the work of Lindeman et al. (2021) and Li et al.
(2004). The mechanical response can include both elastic and viscoelastic effects. You can deﬁne the elastic,
viscoelastic, and thermal expansion properties of the material as functions of the degree of cure and temperature.
Reaction Kinetics
The degree of cure (or conversion) of a material is characterized by a normalized quantity, , with a value
changing from 0 (corresponding to the uncured state; that is, no bonds) to 1 (corresponding to the fully cured
material). Since curing is an irreversible process, the value of the degree of cure that Abaqus computes never
decreases. The value either increases or remains constant. Abaqus provides four methods of specifying the cure

kinetics: the Kamal equations, the Grindling equation, a conversion rate table, and a user-deﬁned form using
user subroutine UCURE.
Kamal model
The Kamal equation provides a well-accepted description of the cure reaction kinetics that is known to produce
accurate results, particularly for epoxy resins. It is given by the following rate form:
where
is the number of terms,
are rate constants,
are activation energies,
 and 
are reaction constants,
is the absolute zero on the temperature scale used, and
is the universal gas constant.
The material constants, , are introduced to allow a nonzero initial conversion rate by setting at least one of
them to a small positive value. Alternatively, you can specify a nonzero initial conversion value, 
, using
initial conditions (see Initial Conditions) or set at least one of the parameters, 
, to zero. If you do not deﬁne
, 
, or 
, the degree of cure (conversion) remains equal to zero throughout the analysis.
The constant, 
, controls the maximum degree of cure. By default, 
. You can deﬁne a different
value, as described in Maximum Conversion.
Use the following options to deﬁne the conversion rate in the Kamal equation:

Grindling model
The Kamal equation describes cure kinetics very well at cure temperatures higher than the glass transition
temperature, where the reaction kinetics is chemically controlled. However, during isothermal curing processes
the curing temperature can fall below the glass transition temperature, 
, even if it was higher than 
 at the
beginning of the curing process. This is because the glass transition temperature depends strongly on the degree
of cure, and its value changes during the curing process. If the curing temperature falls below glass transition
Abaqus Materials Guide
656
Curing Processes in Polymers

temperature, premature vitriﬁcation takes place and the material undergoes a transition from a rubbery to a glassy
state, which slows the curing process rate considerably because the reaction kinetics becomes diffusion controlled.
Although the Kamal model can account for this behavior by limiting the maximum value of conversion by
specifying 
 for temperatures below the glass transition temperature, the Grindling model can predict
gradual transition from the chemically controlled to the diffusion-controlled reaction rates and produce accurate
results in this case. The conversion rate for the Grindling model is given by:
where 
, 
, and 
 are material parameters, 
 is reaction rate, which is assumed to have the Arrhenius-type
form:
where 
 is a material parameter and 
 is the activation energy.
The effective rate coefﬁcient, 
, is used to switch between the chemically and the diffusion-controlled
reaction, and it is given by
where 
 and 
 are the chemically and diffusion controlled rates, respectively. The rate coefﬁcient, 
, has
the Arrhenius-type form similar to the rate coefﬁcient 
:
where 
 is a material parameter and 
 is the activation energy.
The diffusion-controlled rate coefﬁcient, 
, is computed from the following relations depending on the value
of the glass transition temperature:
where 
, 
, and 
 are material parameters and 
 is the diffusion-controlled rate coefﬁcient at the
temperature equal to the glass transition temperature.
The diffusion-controlled rate, 
, strongly depends on the glass transition temperature, which in turn depends
on the degree of cure and possibly other quantities, such as temperature. Therefore, the glass transition temperature
must be speciﬁed when using the Grindling model (see Glass transition temperature).
Use the following options to deﬁne the conversion rate in the Grindling equation:

Curing Processes in Polymers

Glass transition temperature
The glass transition temperature plays an important role during the curing processes. The curing kinetics models
might require the glass transition temperature to be speciﬁed, and the material properties might depend on it.
The glass transition temperature is required for the Grindling model. You must specify the glass transition
temperature for other cure kinetics models if you want to request glass transition temperature output or the output
of the difference between the glass transition temperature and the current temperature (see Output). In addition,
you usually take this approach if you want to consider the dependency of material properties on the difference
between the glass transition temperature and the current temperature (see Cure-Dependent Material Properties).
Abaqus provides two methods to deﬁne the glass transition temperature: the DiBenedetto model and the tabular
form. The DiBenedetto model is widely used and deﬁnes 
 as a function of the degree of cure in the following
form:
where  is a material parameter (
); 
 is the glass transition temperature in the uncured state; and 
is the glass transition temperature in the fully cured state.
Alternatively, you can use a tabular deﬁnition to specify 
 as a piecewise linear function of degree of cure,
temperature, and ﬁeld variables.
Use the following option to specify the glass transition temperature using the
DiBenedetto equation:

User-defined conversion rate
An alternative method to deﬁne the cure kinetics is to specify the degree of cure rate in user subroutine UCURE.
In addition to the degree of cure rate, you must also specify the values of the derivatives of the degree of cure
rate with respect to the temperature and the degree of cure. Optionally, you can also specify the number of
property values needed as data in the user subroutine as well as the number of solution-dependent variables (see
About User Subroutines and Utilities).

In general, the degree of cure can reach a maximum value of 1 (corresponding to a fully cured material). However,
at lower temperatures, the reaction might slow down considerably, and a fully cured state might not be reached
(corresponding to

 is the conversion rate.

Input File Usage:
*MATERIAL

Cure Shrinkage Strain
During the curing process, the material undergoes permanent shrinkage. The shrinkage is due to cross-linking
because the formation of bonds moves the atoms closer together than in the unbonded state. The shrinkage and
thermal strains that develop during the curing process result in residual stresses that might cause warpage of the
ﬁnal product. Predicting residual stress distributions is often one of the main reasons for performing numerical
simulations. You can model the thermal strain using Abaqus capabilities (see Thermal Expansion). The cure
shrinkage strain is expressed in the following general rate form:
where 
 is the cure shrinkage strain,  is the shrinkage coefﬁcient matrix, and  is the conversion rate. Abaqus
supports four forms of cure shrinkage coefﬁcients: volumetric, isotropic, orthotropic, and anisotropic. You can
use the orthotropic and anisotropic forms only with materials where the material directions are deﬁned with local
orientations (see Orientations).
Volumetric Cure Shrinkage Strain
The volumetric cure shrinkage strain is computed from the following rate equation:
In this case, you need to specify only a single coefﬁcient, 
, as a function of temperature and ﬁeld variables.

Input File Usage:
*INITIAL CONDITIONS, TYPE=CURE
Material Options
The mechanical response of the material in the uncured state is typically viscoelastic and, in the fully cured state,
is often viscoelastic. Therefore, the cure modeling capabilities are typically used in combination with the
small-strain or ﬁnite-strain viscoelastic modeling capabilities already available in Abaqus. When these capabilities
are used in conjunction with hyperelastic materials, only the isotropic and volumetric cure shrinkage types are
supported.
Cure-Dependent Material Properties
The elastic and viscoelastic material properties can change considerably as the cross-linking progresses and the
material transitions from the uncured to the cured state. In general, these material properties depend on the degree
of cure, , and the difference between the glass transition temperature and the current temperature, 
.
You can consider the dependency of material properties on both  and 
 in the model by introducing

ﬁeld variables associated with these quantities and specifying the material properties as a function of these ﬁeld
variables (see Specifying Material Data as Functions of Solution-Dependent Variables). Hedegaard et al. (2021)
describe a testing procedure for measuring viscoelastic properties as a function of temperature and conversion
level.

Overview
An acoustic medium:
•
is used to model sound propagation problems;
•
can be used in a purely acoustic analysis or in a coupled acoustic-structural analysis such as the calculation of shock
waves in a ﬂuid or noise levels in a vibration problem;
•
is an elastic medium (usually a ﬂuid) in which stress is purely hydrostatic (no shear stress) and pressure is proportional
to volumetric strain;
•
is speciﬁed as part of a material deﬁnition;
•
must appear in conjunction with a density deﬁnition (see Density);
•
can include ﬂuid cavitation in Abaqus/Explicit when the absolute pressure drops to a limit value;
•
can be deﬁned as a function of temperature and/or ﬁeld variables;
•
can include dissipative effects;
•
can model small pressure changes (small amplitude excitation);
•
can model waves in the presence of steady underlying ﬂow of the medium; and
•
is active only during dynamic analysis procedures (About Dynamic Analysis Procedures).
Defining an Acoustic Medium
The equilibrium equation for small motions of a compressible, inviscid ﬂuid ﬂowing through a resisting matrix
material is taken to be
where p is the dynamic pressure in the ﬂuid (the pressure in excess of any initial static pressure),  is the spatial
position of the ﬂuid particle, 
 is the ﬂuid particle velocity, 
 is the ﬂuid particle acceleration, 
 is the density
of the ﬂuid, and  is the “volumetric drag” (force per unit volume per velocity) caused by the ﬂuid ﬂowing
through the matrix material. The d'Alembert term has been written without convection on the assumption that
Abaqus Materials Guide
664
Acoustic Medium

there is no steady ﬂow of the ﬂuid, which is usually considered to be sufﬁciently accurate for steady ﬂuid
velocities up to Mach 0.1.
The constitutive behavior of the ﬂuid is assumed to be inviscid and compressible, so that the bulk modulus of
an acoustic medium relates the dynamic pressure in the medium to the volumetric strain by
where 
 is the volumetric strain. Both the bulk modulus 
 and the density 
 of an acoustic
medium must be deﬁned.
The bulk modulus 
 can be deﬁned as a function of temperature and ﬁeld variables but does not vary in value
during an implicit dynamic analysis using the subspace projection method (Implicit Dynamic Analysis Using
Direct Integration) or a direct-solution steady-state dynamic analysis (Direct-Solution Steady-State Dynamic
Analysis); for these procedures the value of the bulk modulus at the beginning of the step is used.
Use both of the following options to deﬁne an acoustic medium:

Volumetric Drag
Dissipation of energy (and attenuation of acoustic waves) may occur in an acoustic medium due to a variety of
factors. Such dissipation effects are phenomenologically characterized in the frequency domain by the imaginary
part of the propagation constant, which gives an exponential decay in amplitude as a function of distance. In
Abaqus the simplest way to model this effect is through a “volumetric drag coefﬁcient,”  (force per unit volume
per velocity).
In frequency-domain procedures,  may be frequency dependent.  can be entered as a function of
frequency—
, where f is the frequency in cycles per time (usually Hz)—in addition to temperature and/or
ﬁeld variables only when the acoustic medium is used in a steady-state dynamics procedure. If the acoustic
medium is used in a direct-integration dynamic procedure (including Abaqus/Explicit), the volumetric drag
coefﬁcient is assumed to be independent of frequency and the ﬁrst value entered for the current temperature
and/or ﬁeld variable is used.
In all procedures except direct steady-state dynamics the gradient of 
 is assumed to be small.

Porous Acoustic Material Models
Porous materials are commonly used to suppress acoustic waves; this attenuating effect arises from a number
of effects as the acoustic ﬂuid interacts with the solid matrix. For many categories of materials, the solid matrix
can be approximated as either fully rigid compared to the acoustic ﬂuid or fully limp. In these cases a mechanical
665
Abaqus Materials Guide
Acoustic Medium

model that resolves only acoustic waves will sufﬁce. The acoustic behavior of porous materials can be modeled
in a variety of ways in Abaqus/Standard.
Craggs Model
The model discussed in Craggs (1978) is readily accommodated in Abaqus. Applying this model results in the
dynamic equilibrium equation for the ﬂuid expressed in this form:
where  is the real-valued resistivity,  is the real-valued dimensionless porosity, 
 is the dimensionless
“structure factor,” and 
 is the dimensionless wave number. This equation can be rewritten as
This model, therefore, can be applied straightforwardly in Abaqus by setting the material density equal to 
,
the volumetric drag equal to 
, and the bulk modulus equal to 
. The Craggs model is supported for all
acoustic procedures in Abaqus.
Delany-Bazley and Delany-Bazley-Miki Models
Abaqus/Standard supports the well-known empirical model proposed in Delany & Bazley (1970), which determines
the material properties as a function of frequency and user-deﬁned ﬂow resistivity, ; density, 
; and bulk
modulus, 
. A variation on this model, proposed by Miki (1990) is also available. These models are supported
only for steady-state dynamic procedures.
Both models compute frequency-dependent material characteristic impedance, , and wavenumber or propagation
constant, , according to the following formula:
where

Abaqus/CAE Usage:
General Frequency-Dependent Models
For steady-state dynamic procedures, Abaqus/Standard supports general frequency-dependent complex bulk
modulus and complex density. Using these parameters, data from a wide range of models can be accommodated
in an analysis; for example, see Allard, et. al (1998), Attenborough (1982), Song & Bolton (1999), and Wilson
(1993). These models are used in a variety of applications, such as ocean acoustics, aerospace, automotive, and
architectural acoustic engineering.
The signs of these parameters must be consistent with the sign conventions used in Abaqus, and with conservation
of energy. Abaqus uses a Fourier transform pair formally equivalent to assuming 
 time dependence.
Consequently, the real parts of the density and bulk modulus are positive for all values of frequency, the imaginary
part of the bulk modulus must be positive, and the imaginary part of the density must be negative.
A linear isotropic acoustic material can be fully described with the two frequency-dependent parameters: bulk
modulus, 
, and density, 
. It is common, however, to encounter materials deﬁned in terms of other parameter
pairs, such as characteristic impedance, , wave number or propagation constant, , or speed of sound, . Data
deﬁned with the pair 
 or 
 can be converted into the complex density and bulk modulus form,
beginning from the following standard formulae:
Consistent with the Abaqus sign conventions, the real parts of  and  must be positive; the imaginary part of
 must be negative, and the imaginary part of  must be positive. In commonly observed materials, the ratio of
the magnitude of the imaginary part to the real part for each of these constants is usually much less than one.

Fluid Cavitation
In general, ﬂuids cannot withstand any signiﬁcant tensile stress and are likely to undergo large volume expansion
when the absolute pressure is close to or less than zero. Abaqus/Explicit allows modeling of this phenomenon
through a cavitation pressure limit for the acoustic medium. When the ﬂuid absolute pressure (sum of the dynamic
and initial static pressures) reduces to this limit, the ﬂuid undergoes free volume expansion (i.e., cavitation),
without a further drop in the pressure. If this limit is not deﬁned, the ﬂuid is assumed not to undergo cavitation
even under a tensile, negative absolute pressure, condition.
The constitutive behavior for an acoustic medium capable of undergoing cavitation can be stated as
where a pseudo-pressure 
, a measure of the volumetric strain, is deﬁned as
where 
 is the ﬂuid cavitation limit and 
 is the initial acoustic static pressure. A total wave formulation is
used for a nonlinear acoustic medium undergoing cavitation. This formulation is very similar to the scattered
wave formulation except that the pseudo-pressure, deﬁned as the product of the bulk modulus and the compressive
volumetric strain, plays the role of the material state variable instead of the acoustic dynamic pressure and the
acoustic dynamic pressure is readily available from this pseudo-pressure subject to the cavitation condition.
*ACOUSTIC MEDIUM, CAVITATION LIMIT

Abaqus/CAE Usage:
Defining the Wave Formulation
In the presence of cavitation in Abaqus/Explicit the ﬂuid mechanical behavior is nonlinear. Hence, for an acoustic
problem with incident wave loading and possible cavitation in the ﬂuid, the scattered wave formulation, which
provides a solution for only a scattered wave dynamic acoustic pressure, may not be appropriate. For these cases
the total wave formulation, which solves for the total dynamic acoustic pressure, should be selected. See Acoustic
and Shock Loads for details.

Abaqus/CAE Usage:
Defining the Initial Acoustic Static Pressure
Cavitation occurs when the absolute pressure reaches the cavitation limit value. Abaqus/Explicit allows for an
initial linearly varying hydrostatic pressure in the ﬂuid medium (see Deﬁning Initial Acoustic Static Pressure).
You can specify pressure values at two locations and a node set of the acoustic medium nodes. Abaqus/Explicit
interpolates from these data to initialize the static pressure at all the nodes in the speciﬁed node set. If the pressure
at only one location is speciﬁed, the hydrostatic pressure in the ﬂuid is assumed to be uniform. The acoustic

static pressure is used only for determining the cavitation status of the acoustic element nodes and does not apply
any static loads to the acoustic or structural mesh at their common wetted interface.
*INITIAL CONDITIONS, TYPE=ACOUSTIC STATIC PRESSURE
Input File Usage:
Initial acoustic pressures are not supported in Abaqus/CAE.
Abaqus/CAE Usage:
Defining a Steady Flow Field
Acoustic ﬁnite elements can be used to simulate time-harmonic wave propagation and natural frequency analysis
in the presence of a steady mean ﬂow of the medium. For example, air may move at a speed large enough to
affect the propagation speed of waves in the direction of ﬂow and against it. These effects are modeled in
Abaqus/Standard by specifying an acoustic ﬂow velocity during the linear perturbation analysis step deﬁnition;
you do not need to alter the acoustic material properties. See Coupled Acoustic-Structural Analysis for details.
Elements
An acoustic material deﬁnition can be used only with the acoustic elements in Abaqus (see Choosing the
Appropriate Element for an Analysis Type).
In Abaqus/Standard second-order acoustic elements are more accurate than ﬁrst-order elements. Use at least six
nodes per wavelength  in the acoustic medium to obtain accurate results.
Output
Nodal output variable POR (pressure magnitude) is available for an acoustic medium in Abaqus (in Abaqus/CAE
this output variable is called PAC). When the scattered wave formulation is used with incident wave loading in
Abaqus/Explicit, output variable POR represents only the scattered pressure response of the model and does not
include the incident wave loading itself. When the total wave formulation is used, output variable POR represents
the total dynamic acoustic pressure, which includes contributions from both incident and scattered waves as well
as the dynamic effects of ﬂuid cavitation. For either formulation output variable POR does not include the
acoustic static pressure, which is used only to evaluate the cavitation status in the acoustic medium.
In addition, in Abaqus/Standard nodal output variable PPOR (the pressure phase) is available for an acoustic
medium. In Abaqus/Explicit nodal output variable PABS (the absolute pressure, equal to the sum of POR and
the acoustic static pressure) is available for an acoustic medium.

Overview
A poroelastic acoustic medium:
•
is used in a coupled acoustic-structural analysis, such as determining noise levels in a vibration problem;
•
is a poroelastic medium fully saturated with ﬂuid;
•
is speciﬁed as part of a material deﬁnition;

Frequency Response of a Poroelastic Acoustic Medium
The frequency domain theory of the poroelastic acoustic medium is presented in Poroelastic acoustic medium
in frequency domain. The primary variables in the formulation are structural displacements 
 and ﬂuid pore
pressure . The dynamic equilibrium equations are
Here,  is the steady-state dynamics excitation frequency,  is the porosity deﬁned as the ratio of the connected
volume fully saturated by ﬂuid to the whole volume, 
 is the structural stress, 
 is the structural dilatation,
and parameters with an overtilde (~) are derived from the material properties of the solid structural skeleton and
ﬂuid. The  terms in the equations above represent the ﬂuid-structure volumetric coupling terms. Without these
terms the equations are the regular dynamic equilibrium equations for the separate solid and ﬂuid phases. For
the solid skeleton, there is no 
 factor in the stiffness or density structural terms.
Generally, complex solid and ﬂuid properties and coupling terms are determined from classical isotropic linear
elastic solid properties, including the skeleton density plus the ﬂuid real and complex material densities, complex
bulk modulus, and the medium tortuosity. In the case of no damping, all properties are real valued with zero
imaginary parts. For the solid, the damping can come from structural damping; for the ﬂuid, from nonzero
imaginary parts of the complex density and bulk modulus.
Abaqus Materials Guide

Poroelastic Acoustic Medium

There are two ways to obtain the ﬂuid complex density and bulk modulus: either directly from input data as
implemented in the Biot-Atalla acoustic medium porous model or using special theory under the Biot-Johnson
model. The Biot-Atalla model is a convenient way to compare poroelastic acoustic results versus pure acoustic
results.
Poroelastic Acoustic Material Behavior
The response of the solid skeleton is assumed to be isotropic linear elastic with (optionally) structural damping.
In addition, the porosity of the medium must be speciﬁed as an initial condition.
For the pore ﬂuid, two poroelastic acoustic material models are available: the Biot-Atalla model and the
Biot-Johnson model. You must specify the following parameters for both models: ﬂuid density, tortuosity at
inﬁnite frequency, skeleton material bulk modulus, and the ﬂuid-structure coupling factor (the default is one).
Specifying a coupling factor value of zero leads to an uncoupled ﬂuid and structural response. Additional input
is necessary for both models.
Use the following options for both models:

•
ﬂuid dynamic shear viscosity,
•
ambient ﬂuid standard pressure,
•
ambient ﬂuid heat capacity ratio (the ratio of the speciﬁc heat per unit mass at constant pressure over the
speciﬁc heat per unit mass at constant volume), and

Output
Nodal output variable POR (real and imaginary pore pressure components) is available for poroelastic acoustic
elements in Abaqus. Similar to regular acoustic ﬁnite elements, the output variable POR does not include the
acoustic static pressure. In addition, the nodal output variable PPOR (pressure magnitude and phase) is available
for a poroelastic acoustic medium.
Element integration point output variable GRADP (pore pressure spatial gradient) is available for the ﬂuid phase
of poroelastic acoustic elements. Other element integration point output variables are ACDISP (pore ﬂuid
displacement), ACV (pore ﬂuid velocity), and ACADMIT (poroelastic acoustic admittance, a reciprocal of
impedance).
The solid phase output is the same as for regular solid elements. It includes nodal displacements, velocities,
accelerations, element integration point strains and stresses, etc., all as complex variables.
The stresses in the solid phase include only structural terms, without ﬂuid phase pore pressure contribution.
Similarly, output variable POR is the pure ﬂuid pore pressure.

pressure stress (hydrostatic pressure); and
•
can produce a nonlinear mass diffusion analysis when dependence on concentration is included (the same can be
said for the Soret effect factor and the pressure stress factor).
Defining Diffusivity
Diffusivity is the relationship between the concentration ﬂux, , of the diffusing material and the gradient of the
chemical potential that is assumed to drive the mass diffusion process. Either general mass diffusion behavior
or Fick's diffusion law can be used to deﬁne diffusivity, as discussed below.

• Deﬁning dielectric material properties

Overview
A piezoelectric material:
•
is one in which an electrical ﬁeld causes the material to strain, while stress causes an electric potential gradient;
•
provides linear relations between mechanical and electrical ﬁelds; and
•
is used in piezoelectric elements, which have both displacement and electrical potential as nodal variables.
Defining a Piezoelectric Material
A piezoelectric material responds to an electric potential gradient by straining, while stress causes an electric
potential gradient in the material. This coupling between electric potential gradient and strain is the material's
piezoelectric property. The material will also have a dielectric property so that an electrical charge exists when
the material has a potential gradient. Piezoelectric material behavior is discussed in Piezoelectric analysis.
The mechanical properties of the material must be modeled by linear elasticity (Linear Elastic Behavior). The
mechanical behavior can be deﬁned by
in terms of the piezoelectric stress coefﬁcient matrix, 
, or by
in terms of the piezoelectric strain coefﬁcient matrix, 
. The electrical behavior is deﬁned by
where
is the mechanical stress tensor;
687
Piezoelectric Behavior

is the strain tensor;
is the electric “displacement” vector;
is the material's elastic stiffness matrix deﬁned at zero electrical potential gradient (short circuit condition);
is the material's piezoelectric stress coefﬁcient matrix, deﬁning the stress 
 caused by the electrical
potential gradient 
 in a fully constrained material (it can also be interpreted as the electrical displacement
 caused by the applied strain 
 at a zero electrical potential gradient);
is the material's piezoelectric strain coefﬁcient matrix, deﬁning the strain 
 caused by the electrical
potential gradient 
 in an unconstrained material (an alternative interpretation is given later in this
section);
is the electrical potential;
is the material's dielectric property, deﬁning the relation between the electric displacement  and the
electric potential gradient 
 for a fully constrained material; and
is the electrical potential gradient vector, 
.
The material's electrical and electro-mechanical coupling behaviors are, thus, deﬁned by its dielectric property,
, and its piezoelectric stress coefﬁcient matrix, 
, or its piezoelectric strain coefﬁcient matrix, 
.
These properties are deﬁned as part of the material deﬁnition (Material Data Deﬁnition).
Alternative Forms of the Constitutive Equations
Alternative forms of the piezoelectric constitutive equations are presented in this section. These forms of the
equations involve material properties that cannot be used directly as input for Abaqus/Standard. However, they
are related to the Abaqus/Standard input through simple relations that are presented in Piezoelectric analysis.
Abaqus Materials Guide
688
Piezoelectric Behavior

The intent of this section is to draw connections between the Abaqus/Standard terminology and input to that
used commonly in the piezoelectricity community. The mechanical behavior can also be deﬁned by
in terms of the piezoelectric coefﬁcient matrix 
, and the stiffness matrix 
, which deﬁnes the mechanical
properties at zero electrical displacement (open circuit condition). Likewise, the electrical behavior can also be
deﬁned by
in terms of the dielectric matrix 
 for an unconstrained material or by
where
is the material's elastic stiffness matrix deﬁned at zero electrical displacement;
is the material's piezoelectric strain coefﬁcient matrix used earlier, and based on the equations, may
alternatively be interpreted as the electrical displacement  caused by the stress 
 at zero electrical
potential gradient;
is the material's piezoelectric coefﬁcient matrix, which can be interpreted as deﬁning either the strain 
caused by the electrical displacement 
 in an unconstrained material or the electrical potential gradient
 caused by the stress 
 at zero electrical displacement; and
is the material's dielectric property, deﬁning the relation between the electric displacement  and the
electric potential gradient 
 for an unconstrained material.
These are useful relationships that are often seen in the piezoelectric literature. In Piezoelectric analysis the
properties 
, 
, and 
 are expressed in terms of the properties 
, 
, and 
, that are used
as input for Abaqus/Standard.
Specifying Dielectric Material Properties
The dielectric matrix can be isotropic, orthotropic, or fully anisotropic. For non-isotropic dielectric materials a
local orientation for the material directions must be speciﬁed (Orientations). The entries of the dielectric matrix
(what are referred to as “dielectric constants” in Abaqus) refer to what is more commonly known in the literature
as the permittivity of the material.

(substitute d for e for strain coefﬁcients):
The ﬁrst index on these coefﬁcients refers to the component of electric displacement (sometimes called the
electric ﬂux), while the last pair of indices refers to the component of mechanical stress or strain.
Thus, the piezoelectric components causing electrical displacement in the 1-direction are all given ﬁrst, then
those causing electrical displacement in the 2-direction, and then those causing electrical displacement in the
3-direction. (Some references list these coupling terms in a different order.)

Converting Double Index Notation to Triple Index Notation
Industry-supplied piezoelectric data often use a double index notation. A double index notation can be converted
easily to the required triple index notation in Abaqus/Standard by noting the convention followed in Abaqus for
the correspondence between (second-order) tensor and vector notations: the 11, 22, 33, 12, 13, and 23 components
of the tensor correspond to the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 components, respectively, of the corresponding vector.
Energy Balance Considerations
Abaqus does not account for piezoelectric effects in the total energy balance equation, which can lead to an
apparent imbalance of the total energy of the model in some situations. For example, if a piezoelectric truss is
ﬁxed at one end point and subjected to a potential difference between its two end points, it deforms due to the
piezoelectric effect. Subsequently if the truss is held ﬁxed in this deformed conﬁguration and the potential
difference removed, strain energy will be generated due to the constraints. This results in an equivalent increase
in the total energy of the model.
Elements
Piezoelectric coupling is active only in piezoelectric elements (those with displacement degrees of freedom and
electrical potential degree of freedom 9). See Choosing the Appropriate Element for an Analysis Type.

A piezoresistive material:

Defining a Piezoresistive Material
A piezoresistive material undergoes a change in its electrical resistivity when it is stressed. This coupling between
stress and electrical resistivity is the material's piezoresistivity property. The electrical response of the material

The piezoresistive material properties can be deﬁned by providing the piezoresistivity coefﬁcients. The
piezoresistivity coefﬁcient tensor can be isotropic, cubic, orthotropic, or fully anisotropic. For nonisotropic
piezoresistive materials, you must specify a local orientation for the material directions (Orientations). A
piezoresistive material response also requires the electrical resistivity of the unstressed material. You must specify
the electrical resistivity at zero stress directly; you cannot deﬁne the electrical properties in terms of the electrical
conductivity tensor.

Nonlinear Magnetic Behavior
Nonlinear magnetic behavior is characterized by magnetic permeability that depends on the strength of the
magnetic ﬁeld. The nonlinear magnetic material model in Abaqus is suitable for ideally soft magnetic materials
without any hysteresis effects (see Figure 1) characterized by a monotonically increasing response in B–H space,
where B and H refer to the strengths of the magnetic ﬂux density vector and the magnetic ﬁeld vector, respectively.
Nonlinear magnetic behavior is deﬁned through direct speciﬁcation of one or more B–H curves that provide B
as a function of H and, optionally, temperature and/or predeﬁned ﬁeld variables, in one or more directions.
Nonlinear magnetic behavior can be isotropic, orthotropic, or transversely isotropic (which is a special case of
the more general orthotropic behavior). More than one B–H curve is needed to deﬁne the nonlinear magnetic
behavior if it is not isotropic. For each curve, the slope between the last pair of data points is assumed to be the
permeability of the free space. Abaqus issues an error message if the slope between any two adjacent data points
is less than 0.01 times the permeability of the free space, as computed based on the last two data points for that
curve.
Directional Dependence of Nonlinear Magnetic Behavior
Isotropic, orthotropic, or transversely isotropic nonlinear magnetic behavior can be deﬁned. For non-isotropic
nonlinear magnetic behavior a local orientation for the material directions must be speciﬁed (Orientations).
Isotropic Nonlinear Magnetic Behavior
For isotropic nonlinear magnetic response only one B–H curve is needed at each temperature and ﬁeld variable
value. Isotropic magnetic permeability is the default. Abaqus assumes that the nonlinear magnetic behavior is

Permanent Magnetization
Ferromagnetic materials can be magnetized by placing them in a magnetic ﬁeld, which is typically created by
applying currents in a system of coil windings surrounding the material being magnetized. These materials can
be classiﬁed into soft and hard magnetic materials (see Figure 1). Soft magnetic materials lose their magnetization
after removal of the applied currents (see Nonlinear Magnetic Behavior). Hard magnetic materials retain their
magnetization permanently after removal of the applied currents. The leftover magnetization in a permanent
magnet is called remanence, denoted by 
 in Figure 2. This magnetization can be removed by applying currents

About Pore Fluid Flow Properties
Overview
Abaqus allows speciﬁc properties to be deﬁned for a ﬂuid-ﬁlled porous material.
In Abaqus/Standard, this type of porous medium is considered in a coupled pore ﬂuid diffusion/stress analysis (Coupled
Pore Fluid Diffusion and Stress Analysis). In Abaqus/Explicit, this type of porous medium is considered in an undrained
pore ﬂuid ﬂow and stress analysis (Undrained Pore Fluid Flow and Stress Analysis).
The following properties are available:
Permeability
Permeability deﬁnes the relationship between the ﬂow rate of a liquid through a porous medium and the gradient
of the piezometric head of that ﬂuid (see Permeability) in Abaqus/Standard analyses.
You cannot specify permeability in an undrained pore ﬂuid ﬂow and stress analysis (where the permeability is
assumed to be zero) in Abaqus/Explicit.
Porous bulk moduli
The bulk moduli of the solid grains and of the ﬂuid in a porous medium are deﬁned such that their compressibility
is considered in an analysis (see Porous Bulk Moduli).
Sorption
Sorption deﬁnes the absorption/exsorption behavior of a porous material under partially saturated ﬂow conditions
(see Sorption) in Abaqus/Standard analyses.
You cannot specify sorption in an undrained pore ﬂuid ﬂow and stress analysis (where the ﬂow is assumed to
be fully saturated) in Abaqus/Explicit.
Swelling gel
The swelling gel model is used to simulate the growth of gel particles that swell and trap wetting liquid in a
partially saturated porous medium (see Swelling Gel).
Swelling gel applies only to Abaqus/Standard analyses.
Moisture swelling
Moisture swelling deﬁnes the saturation-driven volumetric swelling of a porous medium's solid skeleton under
partially saturated ﬂow conditions (see Moisture Swelling).
Moisture swelling applies only to Abaqus/Standard analyses.

Overview
Permeability is the relationship between the volumetric ﬂow rate per unit area of a particular wetting liquid through a
porous medium and the gradient of the effective ﬂuid pressure. It can be speciﬁed in Abaqus/Standard.
Permeability in Abaqus/Standard:
•
must be speciﬁed for a wetting liquid for an effective stress/wetting liquid diffusion analysis (see Coupled Pore
Fluid Diffusion and Stress Analysis);
•
is deﬁned, in general, by Forchheimer's law, which accounts for changes in permeability as a function of ﬂuid ﬂow
velocity; and
•
can be isotropic, orthotropic, or fully anisotropic and can be given as a function of void ratio, saturation, temperature,
and ﬁeld variables.
Permeability in Abaqus/Standard
Permeability is deﬁned for pore ﬂuid ﬂow.
Forchheimer's Law
According to Forchheimer's law, high ﬂow velocities have the effect of reducing the effective permeability and,
therefore, “choking” pore ﬂuid ﬂow. As the ﬂuid ﬂow velocity reduces, Forchheimer's law approximates the
well-known Darcy's law. Darcy's law can, therefore, be used directly in Abaqus/Standard by omitting the
velocity-dependent term in Forchheimer's law.
Forchheimer's law is written as

The void ratio can be derived from the porosity, n, using the relationship

may be needed to deﬁne the fully saturated permeability, depending on whether isotropic, orthotropic, or fully
anisotropic permeability is to be modeled (discussed below).

Overview
Sorption:
•
deﬁnes a porous material's absorption/exsorption behavior under partially saturated ﬂow conditions; and
•
is used in the analysis of coupled wetting liquid ﬂow and porous medium stress (Coupled Pore Fluid Diffusion and
Stress Analysis).
Sorption
A porous medium becomes partially saturated when the total pore liquid pressure, 
, becomes negative (see
Effective stress principle for porous media). Negative values of 
 represent capillary effects in the medium.
For 
 it is known that the saturation lies within certain limits that depend on the value of the capillary
pressure, 
 (see Continuity statement for the wetting liquid phase in a porous medium). Typical forms of
these limits are shown in Figure 1. We write these limits as 
, where 
 is the limit at which
absorption will occur (so that 
), and 
 is the limit at which exsorption will occur (so that 
).
The transition between absorption and exsorption and vice versa takes place along “scanning” curves (discussed
below). These curves are approximated by the single straight line shown in Figure 1.

When partial saturation is included in the analysis of ﬂow through a porous medium, the absorption behavior,
the exsorption behavior, and the scanning behavior (between absorption and exsorption) should each be deﬁned.
Each of these behaviors is discussed below. If sorption is not deﬁned at all, Abaqus/Standard assumes fully
saturated ﬂow (
) for all values of

Strongly unsymmetric partially saturated ﬂow coupled equations result from the deﬁnition of sorption. Therefore,
Abaqus/Standard automatically uses its unsymmetric matrix storage and solution scheme (see Deﬁning an
Analysis) if you request partially saturated analysis (i.e., if sorption is deﬁned).
Defining Absorption and Exsorption
Absorption and exsorption behaviors are deﬁned by specifying the pore liquid pressure, 
 (negative “capillary
tension”), as a function of saturation. In most physical cases the wetting liquid cannot be driven to zero saturation;
to achieve zero saturation, the data would have to deﬁne 
 as

Overview
The swelling gel model:
•
allows for modeling of the growth of gel particles that swell and trap wetting liquid in a partially saturated porous
medium;
•
is intended for use in moisture absorption problems, which typically involve polymeric materials, such as in the
analysis of diapers; and
•
can be used in the analysis of coupled pore liquid ﬂow and porous medium stress (see Coupled Pore Fluid Diffusion
and Stress Analysis).
Swelling Gel Model
The simple swelling gel model is based on the idealization of a gel as a volume of individual spherical particles
of equal radius, 
. The swelling evolution (discussed in detail in Constitutive behavior in a porous medium) is
assumed to be given by
where the value of any grouping of terms in angled brackets  is set equal to zero if its mathematical result is
not positive, and
is the fully swollen radius;
is the relaxation time of the gel particles;
s
is the saturation of the surrounding medium;

is the radius of the gel particles when they are completely dry;
is the maximum radius that the gel particles can achieve before they must touch;
is the effective gel radius when the volume is entirely occupied with gel;
is the initial porosity of the material;
J
is the volume change in the material; and
is the number of gel particles per unit volume.
The second term in the deﬁnition of gel growth incorporates the assumption that the gel will swell only when
the saturation of the surrounding medium, s, exceeds the effective saturation of the gel. The third term in the
growth equation reduces the swelling rate when the surface of gel particles exposed to free ﬂuid is limited by
the combination of packing density and gel particle radius.
The swelling gel model is deﬁned by specifying the variables

Overview
Moisture swelling:

deﬁnes the saturation-driven volumetric swelling of the solid skeleton of a porous medium in partially saturated
ﬂow conditions;
•
can be used in the analysis of coupled wetting liquid ﬂow and porous medium stress (see Coupled Pore Fluid
Diffusion and Stress Analysis); and
•
can be either isotropic or anisotropic.
Moisture Swelling Model
The moisture swelling model assumes that the volumetric swelling of the porous medium's solid skeleton is a
function of the saturation of the wetting liquid in partially saturated ﬂow conditions. The porous medium is
partially saturated when the pore liquid pressure, 
, is negative (see Effective stress principle for porous media).
The swelling behavior is assumed to be reversible. The logarithmic measure of swelling strain is calculated with
reference to the initial saturation so that

You can deﬁne the initial saturation values as initial conditions. If no initial saturation values are given, the
default is fully saturated conditions (saturation of 1.0). For partial saturation the initial saturation and pore ﬂuid
pressure must be consistent, in the sense that the pore ﬂuid pressure must lie within the absorption and exsorption
values for the initial saturation value (see Permeability). If this is not the case, Abaqus/Standard will adjust the
saturation value as needed to satisfy this requirement.

Overview
User-deﬁned mechanical material behavior in Abaqus:
•
is provided by means of an interface whereby any mechanical constitutive model can be added to the library;
•
requires that a constitutive model (or a library of models) is programmed in user subroutine UMAT (Abaqus/Standard)
or VUMAT (Abaqus/Explicit); and
•
requires considerable effort and expertise: the feature is very general and powerful, but its use is not a routine
exercise.
Stress Components and Strain Increments
The subroutine interface has been implemented using Cauchy stress components (“true” stress). For soils problems
“stress” should be interpreted as effective stress. The strain increments are deﬁned by the symmetric part of the
displacement increment gradient (equivalent to the time integral of the symmetric part of the velocity gradient).
The orientation of the stress and strain components in user subroutine UMAT depends on the use of local
orientations (Orientations).
In user subroutine VUMAT all strain measures are calculated with respect to the midincrement conﬁguration.
All tensor quantities are deﬁned in the corotational coordinate system that rotates with the material point. To
illustrate what this means in terms of stresses, consider the bar shown in Figure 1, which is stretched and rotated
from its original conﬁguration, 
, to its new position, 
. This deformation can be obtained in two stages;
the bar is ﬁrst stretched, as shown in Figure 2, and is then rotated by applying a rigid body rotation to it, as
shown in Figure 3.

The stress in the bar after it has been stretched is 
, and this stress does not change during the rigid body
rotation. The 
 coordinate system that rotates as a result of the rigid body rotation is the corotational coordinate
system. The stress tensor and state variables are, therefore, computed directly and updated in user subroutine
VUMAT using the strain tensor since all of these quantities are in the corotational system; these quantities do
not have to be rotated by the user subroutine as is sometimes required in user subroutine UMAT.
The elastic response predicted by a rate-form constitutive law depends on the objective stress rate employed.
For example, the Green-Naghdi stress rate is used in VUMAT. However, the stress rate used for built-in material
models may differ. For example, most material models used with solid (continuum) elements in Abaqus/Explicit
employ the Jaumann stress rate. This difference in the formulation will cause signiﬁcant differences in the results
only if ﬁnite rotation of a material point is accompanied by ﬁnite shear. For a discussion of the objective stress
rates used in Abaqus, see Stress rates.

Material Constants
Any material constants that are needed in user subroutine UMAT or VUMAT must be speciﬁed as part of a
user-deﬁned material behavior deﬁnition. Any other mechanical material behaviors included in the same material
deﬁnition (except thermal expansion and, in Abaqus/Explicit, density) will be ignored; the user-deﬁned material
behavior requires that all mechanical material behavior calculations be programmed in subroutine UMAT or
VUMAT. In Abaqus/Explicit the density (Density) is required when using a user-deﬁned material behavior.

Hybrid Formulation in Abaqus/Standard
If you use a hybrid element with user subroutine UMAT, by default Abaqus/Standard replaces the pressure stress
calculated from the stress tensor returned by the user subroutine with that derived from the Lagrange multiplier
and modiﬁes the Jacobian appropriately (Hybrid incompressible solid element formulation). This approach is
suitable for material models that use an incremental formulation (for example, metal plasticity) but is not consistent
Abaqus Materials Guide
722
User-Defined Mechanical Material Behavior

with the total formulation that is commonly used for hyperelastic materials. In the latter situation the default
formulation may lead to convergence problems. Such convergence problems may be observed, for example,
when an almost incompressible nonlinear elastic user material is subjected to large deformations. Abaqus/Standard
provides an alternate total formulation that is more appropriate in such situations. The total formulation is
consistent with the native almost incompressible formulation used by Abaqus for hyperelastic materials
(Hyperelastic material behavior), and works better than the default (incremental) formulation for such cases.
Abaqus/Standard also provides a fully incompressible formulation for use with hybrid elements to deﬁne a fully
incompressible user material response. The fully incompressible formulation is consistent with the native
formulation used by Abaqus for incompressible hyperelastic materials. For the total hybrid formulation it is
assumed that the deviatoric and the volumetric responses of the material are decoupled and that the volumetric
response can be derived from a strain energy potential function. All the native hyperelastic materials in Abaqus
use this assumption. For the incompressible hybrid formulation, it is assumed that the deviatoric stress can be
derived from a strain energy potential function.
The total hybrid formulation is useful for an almost incompressible hyperelastic response. The volumetric
response of the material is assumed to be deﬁned in terms of an alternate variable, 
, in place of the volume
change, . The alternate variable is made available inside user subroutine UMAT. Further details are discussed
in UMAT.
The fully incompressible formulation requires you to deﬁne only the deviatoric parts of the stress tensor and the
material's Jacobian matrix inside the UMAT. Abaqus/Standard automatically accounts for the pressure stress
based on the Lagrange multiplier.

Material State
Many mechanical constitutive models require the storage of solution-dependent state variables (plastic strains,
“back stress,” saturation values, etc. in rate constitutive forms or historical data for theories written in integral
form). You should allocate storage for these variables in the associated material deﬁnition (see Allocating Space
for Solution-Dependent State Variables). There is no restriction on the number of state variables associated with
a user-deﬁned material.
723
Abaqus Materials Guide
User-Defined Mechanical Material Behavior

The user material subroutines are provided with the material state at the start of each increment, as described
below. They must return values for the new stresses and the new internal state variables. State variables associated
with UMAT and VUMAT can be output to the output database ﬁle (.odb) and results ﬁle (.fil) using the
output identiﬁers SDV and SDVn (see Abaqus/Standard Output Variable Identiﬁers and Abaqus/Explicit Output
Variable Identiﬁers).
Material State in Abaqus/Standard
User subroutine UMAT is called for each material point at each iteration of every increment. It is provided with
the material state at the start of the increment (stress, solution-dependent state variables, temperature, and any
predeﬁned ﬁeld variables) and with the increments in temperature, predeﬁned state variables, strain, and time.
In addition to updating the stresses and the solution-dependent state variables to their values at the end of the
increment, subroutine UMAT must also provide the material Jacobian matrix, 
, for the mechanical
constitutive model. This matrix will also depend on the integration scheme used if the constitutive model is in
rate form and is integrated numerically in the subroutine. For any nontrivial constitutive model these will be
challenging tasks. For example, the accuracy with which the Jacobian matrix is deﬁned will usually be a major
determinant of the convergence rate of the solution and, therefore, will have a strong inﬂuence on computational
efﬁciency.
If you specify the viscoelastic behavior of materials in the frequency domain, user subroutine UMAT must also
provide the damping (loss modulus) contribution to the material Jacobian matrix, in addition to the stiffness
(storage modulus) contribution.
Material State in Abaqus/Explicit
User subroutine VUMAT is called for blocks of material points at each increment. When the subroutine is called,
it is provided with the state at the start of the increment (stress, solution-dependent state variables). It is also
provided with the stretches and rotations at the beginning and the end of the increment. The VUMAT user material
interface passes a block of material points to the subroutine on each call, which allows vectorization of the
material subroutine.
The temperature is provided to user subroutine VUMAT at the start and the end of the increment. The temperature
is passed in as information only and cannot be modiﬁed, even in a fully coupled thermal-stress analysis. However,
if the inelastic heat fraction is deﬁned in conjunction with the speciﬁc heat and conductivity in a fully coupled
thermal-stress analysis in Abaqus/Explicit, the heat ﬂux due to inelastic energy dissipation will be calculated
automatically. If the VUMAT user subroutine is used to deﬁne an adiabatic material behavior (conversion of
plastic work to heat) in an explicit dynamics procedure, you must specify both the inelastic heat fraction and the
speciﬁc heat for the material, and you must store the temperatures and integrate them as user-deﬁned state
variables. Most often the temperatures are provided by specifying initial conditions (Initial Conditions) and are
constant throughout the analysis.
Deleting Elements from a Mesh Using State Variables
Element deletion in a mesh can be controlled during the course of an Abaqus analysis through user subroutine
VUMAT or UMAT. Deleted elements have no ability to carry stresses and, therefore, have no contribution to the
stiffness of the model. You specify the state variable number controlling the element deletion ﬂag. For example,
specifying a state variable number of 4 indicates that the fourth state variable is the deletion ﬂag in the user
subroutine. The deletion state variable should be set to a value of one or zero. A value of one indicates that the
material point is active, while a value of zero indicates that Abaqus should delete the material point from the
model by setting the stresses to zero. In Abaqus/Explicit the structure of the block of material points passed to
user subroutine VUMAT remains unchanged during the analysis; deleted material points are not removed from
the block. Abaqus/Explicit passes zero stresses and strain increments for all deleted material points. Once a
material point is ﬂagged as deleted, it cannot be reactivated. An element is deleted from a mesh based on the
material point status (active or deleted). Details for element deletion driven by material failure are described in
Abaqus Materials Guide

Scaling the Transverse Shear Stiffness for Shell Elements Using State Variables
In an Abaqus/Explicit analysis, you can control the transverse shear stiffness for shell elements with user
subroutine VUMAT. You specify the state variable number controlling the shell element transverse shear damage
variable. For example, specifying a state variable number of 5 indicates that the ﬁfth state variable is the shell
element transverse shear damage variable in the user subroutine. You can set the state variable to a value between
zero and one, with a default value of one indicating the initial undamaged state. The transverse shear stiffness
scaling factor is computed using a weighted average through the section of the state values that you deﬁne. The
transverse shear stiffness scaling factor is used to scale the transverse shear stiffness of the shell elements.

Abaqus/CAE Usage:
Hourglass Control and Transverse Shear Stiffness
Normally the default hourglass control stiffness for reduced-integration elements in Abaqus/Standard and the
transverse shear stiffness for shell, pipe, and beam elements are deﬁned based on the elasticity associated with
the material (Section Controls, Shell Section Behavior, and Choosing a Beam Element). These stiffnesses are
based on a typical value of the initial shear modulus of the material, which may, for example, be given as part
of an elastic material behavior (Linear Elastic Behavior) included in the material deﬁnition. However, the shear
modulus is not available during the preprocessing stage of input for materials deﬁned with user subroutine UMAT
or VUMAT. Therefore, you must provide the hourglass stiffness parameters (see Methods for Suppressing
Hourglass Modes) when using UMAT to deﬁne the material behavior of elements with hourglassing modes.
You must specify the transverse shear modulus for the material (see Deﬁning the Elastic Transverse Shear
Modulus) or the transverse shear stiffness for the section (see Choosing a Beam Element or Shell Section Behavior)
when using user subroutine UMAT or VUMAT to deﬁne the material behavior of beams and shells with transverse
shear ﬂexibility. If the transverse shear modulus is speciﬁed for a user-deﬁned mechanical material that is
associated with shells, Abaqus calls user subroutine UMAT or VUMAT in the data check phase of the analysis
to obtain the initial plane stress elastic stiffness. It then computes the transverse shear stiffness by matching the
shear response for the case of the shell bending about one axis (see Transverse shear stiffness in composite shells
and offsets from the midsurface).
Defining the Effective Modulus to Control Time Incrementation in Abaqus/Explicit
The stable time increment in Abaqus/Explicit is a function of the dilatational wave speed of the material and the
characteristic length of the element. By default, the dilatational wave speed is determined automatically by
Abaqus/Explicit using a numerical calculation of the effective hypoelastic bulk and shear moduli from the user
material's constitutive response. In situations when the user material is highly nonlinear, this calculation may
not yield a conservative value of the time increment, leading to unstable behavior. To avoid these situations,
you can deﬁne the values of the effective bulk and shear moduli directly inside user subroutine VUMAT. These
725

values are then used by Abaqus/Explicit to compute the dilatational wave speed and the stable time increment.

VUINTER, and VUINTERACTION are availabe for deﬁning interfacial constitutive behavior.
Material Options
A number of material behaviors can be used in the deﬁnition of a material when its mechanical behavior is
deﬁned by user subroutine UMAT or VUMAT. These behaviors include density, thermal expansion, permeability,
and heat transfer properties. Thermal expansion can alternatively be an integral part of the constitutive model
implemented in UMAT or VUMAT.
The temperature available in UMAT is always the interpolated temperature ﬁeld at the element integration points.
Naturally, if the thermal expansion behavior is implemented in UMAT, it is deﬁned in terms of the integration
point temperature. When the temperature ﬁeld is interpolated differently within an element compared to the
displacement ﬁeld in Abaqus/Standard, implementing the thermal expansion behavior in UMAT may lead to
differences compared to the built-in thermal expansion behavior. This situation commonly arises for coupled
temperature-displacement elements. For example, for ﬁrst-order coupled temperature-displacement elements,
the built-in thermal expansion behavior uses a constant temperature ﬁeld over the whole element (see Fully
Coupled Thermal-Stress Analysis), while the behavior in UMAT will be deﬁned in terms of a linear temperature
ﬁeld.
For a material deﬁned by user subroutine UMAT or VUMAT, mass proportional damping can be included
separately (see Material Damping), but stiffness proportional damping must be deﬁned in the user subroutine
by the Jacobian (Abaqus/Standard only) and stress deﬁnitions. Stiffness proportional damping cannot be speciﬁed
if the user material is used in the direct steady-state dynamics procedure.
Elements
User subroutines UMAT and VUMAT can be used with all elements in Abaqus that include mechanical behavior
(elements that have displacement degrees of freedom).

Overview
User-deﬁned thermal material behavior in Abaqus:
•
is provided by means of an interface whereby any thermal constitutive model can be added to the library;
•
requires that a constitutive model (or a library of models) is programmed in user subroutine UMATHT
(Abaqus/Standard) or VUMATHT (Abaqus/Explicit);
•
must appear in conjunction with a density deﬁnition (see Density); and
•
requires considerable effort and expertise: the feature is very general and powerful, but its use is not a routine
exercise.
Material Constants
Any material constants that are needed in user subroutine UMATHT or VUMATHT must be speciﬁed as part of
a user-deﬁned thermal material behavior deﬁnition. Any other thermal material behaviors included in the same
material deﬁnition will be ignored: the user-deﬁned thermal material behavior requires that all thermal behavior
calculations are programmed in user subroutine UMATHT or VUMATHT.

Material State
Many thermal constitutive models require the storage of solution-dependent state variables. These state variables
might include microstructure or phase content information when the material undergoes phase changes. You
should allocate storage for these variables in the associated material deﬁnition (see Allocating Space for
Solution-Dependent State Variables). There is no restriction on the number of state variables associated with a
user-deﬁned material.
User subroutine UMATHT is called for each material point at each iteration of every increment. It is provided
with the thermal state of the material at the start of the increment (solution-dependent state variables, temperature,
and any predeﬁned ﬁeld variables) and with the increments in temperature, predeﬁned state variables, and time.
User subroutine VUMATHT is called for blocks of material points at each increment. When the subroutine is
called, it is provided with the state at the start of the increment (temperature, internal energy per unit mass,
solution-dependent variables, and any predeﬁned ﬁeld variables) and the state at the end of the increment
(temperature, spatial gradients of temperature). The VUMATHT user material interface passes a block of material
points to the subroutine on each call, which allows vectorization of the material subroutine.
Required Calculations
User subroutine UMATHT must perform the following functions: it must deﬁne the internal energy per unit mass
and its variation with respect to temperature and spatial gradients of temperature; it must deﬁne the heat ﬂux
vector and its variation with respect to temperature and spatial gradients of temperature; and it must update the
solution-dependent state variables to their values at the end of the increment. The components of the heat ﬂux
and spatial gradients in user subroutine UMATHT are in directions that depend on the use of local orientations
(see Orientations).
User subroutine VUMATHT must return the following values at the end of the increment: the internal energy
per unit mass and its variation with respect to temperature, the heat ﬂux vector, solution-dependent state variables
and an effective conductivity. The effective conductivity is required to estimate the element stable time increment
size in Abaqus/Explicit. Since the stable time increment size is inversely proportional to conductivity, you can
provide the largest value in conductivity tensor to obtain a conservative estimation of the stable time increment
size.
Use with Other User Subroutines
Any other user subroutine that does not deal with constitutive thermal behavior for a material can be used in
conjunction with user subroutines UMATHT and VUMATHT.
In Abaqus/Standard user subroutine UMAT can be used in conjunction with UMATHT to deﬁne the constitutive
mechanical behavior of the material. The solution-dependent variables allocated in the material deﬁnition are
accessible in both UMATHT and UMAT. In addition, user subroutines FRIC, GAPCON, and GAPELECTR are
available for separately deﬁning mechanical, thermal, and electrical interactions between surfaces; and user
subroutine UINTER is available for deﬁning general interfacial constitutive behavior. User subroutine HETVAL
for user-deﬁned internal heat generation can be used in conjunction with user subroutine UMATHT.
In Abaqus/Explicit user subroutine VUMAT can be used in conjunction with user subroutine VUMATHT to deﬁne
the constitutive mechanical behavior of the material. The solution-dependent variables allocated in the material
deﬁnition are accessible in both VUMATHT and VUMAT. In addition, user subroutines VFRIC, VFRICTION,
VUINTER, and VUINTERACTION are available for deﬁning interfacial constitutive behavior. User subroutine
VHETVAL for user-deﬁned internal heat generation can be used in conjunction with user subroutine VUMATHT.

Overview
The cure modeling capabilities:
•
are intended to model the curing process in adhesives and other polymer materials;
•
predict the degree of cure, volumetric heat generation, and shrinkage strain due to curing reactions;
•
allow you to specify a maximum value of the degree of cure;
•
are intended for use with existing elastic and viscoelastic behaviors that describe the mechanical response of the
material as a function of the degree of cure; and
•
must be used with the fully coupled thermal-stress analysis (see Fully Coupled Thermal-Stress Analysis).
Alternatively, Abaqus offers another method of deﬁning the cure model that uses dedicated cure modeling options and
output variables (see Curing Processes in Polymers). This method is more general and is intended to supersede the
capabilities described in this section.
Curing processes are essential to the manufacturing of products that use thermosetting polymers (such as epoxy resins)
to bond components. The use of epoxies and other cured structural adhesives is common in many industries. As a result
of the curing reaction, chemical shrinkage strains and residual stresses develop, which can result in damage to the
adherends or warpage of the bonded assembly. The Abaqus cure modeling capability enables you to analyze curing
processes, including the reaction kinetics, heat generation, shrinkage strain development, and the evolution of mechanical
properties. The model is based on the work of Lindeman et al. (2021) and Li et al. (2004). You can describe the reaction
kinetics using either the Kamal equation or a conversion rate table. The mechanical response can include both elastic
and viscoelastic effects. You can deﬁne the elastic, viscoelastic, and thermal expansion properties of the material as
functions of conversion and temperature.
The cure model is available as a special-purpose material modeling capability based on built-in user-deﬁned material
options. To activate the capability, the material name must start with "ABQ_CURE_MATERIAL" and the material
deﬁnition must include a user-deﬁned eigenstrain deﬁnition. In addition, you must deﬁne the cure modeling coefﬁcients
using parameter and property tables with a declared type that starts with "ABQ_Cure" (as described in the following
sections). You must allocate at least three solution-dependent state variables.
A dedicated collection of parameter and property tables is available to include all of the deﬁnitions required to use the
model. You can use the abaqus fetch utility to obtain the ﬁle containing the type deﬁnitions for the parameter and
property tables used by the cure model:

Reaction Kinetics
The degree of cure (or conversion) of a material is characterized by a normalized quantity, , with a value
changing from 0 (corresponding to the uncured state; that is, no bonds) to 1 (corresponding to the fully cured
material).
The cure reaction kinetics control the rate of conversion, , as a function of  and temperature. The Kamal
equation provides a well accepted description of the cure reaction kinetics that is known to produce accurate
results, particularly for epoxy resins. It is given by the following rate form:
   Equation 1
where 
 is the number of terms, 
 are rate constants, 
 are activation energies, 
 and 
 are reaction constants,
 is the absolute zero on the temperature scale used, and  is the universal gas constant. The material constants,
, are introduced to allow a nonzero initial conversion rate by setting at least one of them to a small positive
value. Alternatively, you can specify a nonzero initial conversion value, 
, using initial conditions (see
Solution-Dependent State Variables). If you do not deﬁne  or 
, the degree of cure (conversion) remains
equal to zero throughout the analysis.
The constant, 
, controls the maximum degree of cure. By default, 
. You can deﬁne a different
value, as described in Maximum Conversion.
In addition to the Kamal equation, you can specify the rate of conversion, , in a tabular format. This format
allows you to express the rate as a function of conversion and, optionally, temperature and ﬁeld variables:
Curing is an irreversible process; therefore, the value of the degree of cure that Abaqus computes never decreases.
The value either increases or remains constant.

In general, the degree of cure can reach a maximum value of 1 (corresponding to a fully cured material). However,

(corresponding to 
). You can specify the maximum conversion as a function of temperature. The default

Cure Shrinkage Strain
During the curing process, the material undergoes permanent shrinkage. The shrinkage is due to cross-linking
because the formation of bonds moves the atoms closer together than in the unbonded state. The shrinkage and
thermal strains that develop during the curing process result in residual stresses that might cause warpage of the
ﬁnal product. Predicting residual stress distributions is often one of the main reasons for performing numerical
simulations. You can model the thermal strain using Abaqus capabilities (see Thermal Expansion). The cure
shrinkage strain is expressed in the following general rate form:
where 
 is the cure shrinkage strain,  is the shrinkage coefﬁcient matrix, and  is the conversion rate. Abaqus
supports four forms to specify cure shrinkage coefﬁcients: volumetric, isotropic, orthotropic, and anisotropic.
You can use the orthotropic and anisotropic forms only with materials where the material directions are deﬁned
with local orientations (see Orientations).
The cure shrinkage strains enter the constitutive model in the form of an eigenstrain. Similar to thermal strains,
the cure shrinkage strains are subtracted from the total deformation to compute the mechanical stress response.

Mechanical Response of the Material
The mechanical response of the material in the uncured state is typically viscoelastic and, in the fully cured state,
is often viscoelastic. Therefore, the cure modeling capabilities are typically used in combination with the
small-strain viscoelastic modeling capabilities already available in Abaqus.
Cure-Dependent Material Properties
The elastic and viscoelastic material properties can change considerably as the cross-linking progresses and the
material transitions from the uncured to the cured state. In general, these material properties depend on the degree
of cure. To obtain accurate results, you must account for this dependency. You can consider the dependency of
material properties on the degree of cure in the model by associating the value of a ﬁeld variable with the degree
of cure and specifying the material properties as a function of this ﬁeld variable (see Specifying Material Data
as Functions of Solution-Dependent Variables). Hedegaard et al. (2021) describe a testing procedure for measuring
viscoelastic properties as a function of temperature and conversion level.
Solution-Dependent State Variables
The cure modeling capability is available as a special-purpose material model that makes use of solution-dependent
state variables (SDVs) for multiple purposes, such as deﬁning state variables, initial values of state variables,
and output (see Solution-Dependent State Variables). You must allocate at least three solution-dependent state
variables. The meaning of the different SDVs is described in the table below.

Overview
A special-purpose built-in user-deﬁned ﬁeld option is available for modeling metallurgical phase transformations
during additive manufacturing processes. You can deﬁne material properties as functions of ﬁeld variables associated
with the metallurgical state. This functionality is also applicable to more traditional heat treatment processes.
The special-purpose ﬁeld option is accessed by using material names and parameter and property table types that start
with "ABQ_PHASE_TRANS" as described below.
Abaqus provides a general metallurgical phase transformation framework applicable to arbitrary metal alloys. The
framework accounts for material physical state changes from a stock feed (that is, a raw material, such as metal powder)
via melting and solidiﬁcation followed by metallurgical solid-state phase transformations induced by rapid heating or
cooling events. These events are associated with typical three-dimensional printing sequences but also with slow-rate
temperature evolutions associated with heat treatment applications. Grain morphology and grain size assessment models
can also be included.
The metallurgical phase transformation framework is available as a special-purpose user-deﬁned ﬁeld option that relies
on built-in user ﬁelds to track phase changes and the corresponding variation of material properties. To activate the
framework, the material name must start with the string ABQ_PHASE_TRANS, the material deﬁnition must include
parameter and property tables with a declared type that starts with "ABQ_PHASE_TRANS" (as explained in the
following sections), and you must specify user-deﬁned ﬁeld variables and allocate at least 
solution-dependent state variables, where 
 and 
 are the number of all possible solid phases and solid-phase
transformations associated with the material, respectively. Abaqus uses an "internal" implementation of user subroutine
USDFLD.
A dedicated collection of parameter and property tables is available to include all of the deﬁnitions required to model
physical transitions and metallurgical phase transformations or to assess grain morphology and grain size. You can
use the abaqus fetch utility to obtain the ﬁle containing the type deﬁnitions of the parameter and property tables used
by the metallurgical phase transformation framework as follows:

Material Physical Raw-Liquid-Solid (RLS) State
You can specify a temperature range to model physical state changes. During an additive manufacturing process,
the raw (unfused) material is melted to a liquid state by an intense moving heat source, and then undergoes
cooling and solidiﬁcation when the heat source is removed. The solidiﬁed (fused) material can be remelted when
the heat source passes by a nearby location. As shown in Figure 1, the transitions between raw, liquid, and solid
states of a material alloy are considered to be governed by temperature and occur within a temperature range
bounded by the solidus and liquidus temperature of the alloy.

Solid-Phase Transformation
The rapid heating and cooling events associated with additive manufacturing processes and slower heat treatment
applications can induce metallurgical solid-phase transformations. You can deﬁne all possible solid phases and
the set of rules that govern their transformations.
A solid-phase transformation can be written in the form
where 
 and 
 are the number of parent and child phases, respectively; and 
 and 
 are the 
 parent and
the 
 child phases, respectively.
The change of volume fraction of a parent phase during a transformation is assumed to be proportional to its
current volume fraction. A similar assumption is made for child phases. With these assumptions, a transformation
can be simpliﬁed as
Abaqus Materials Guide
740
Modeling Metallurgical Phase Transformations

consisting of one main parent phase and one main child phase with volume fractions of 
 and
, respectively.
A transformation usually occurs in a speciﬁc thermal condition. You can specify the conditions in terms of
temperature rate and/or temperature range for a transformation. If both rate and range are speciﬁed, the
transformation occurs when both conditions are satisﬁed.
Two types of transformation mechanisms are available: diffusional or martensitic (nondiffusional).
The following steps are required to deﬁne solid-phase transformations completely:
1. Deﬁne the information for all solid phases using a parameter table of type
"ABQ_PHASE_TRANS_SolidPhases".
2. Deﬁne the information for all solid-phase transformations using a parameter table of type
"ABQ_PHASE_TRANS_Transformations".
3. Deﬁne the kinetics of each transformation by either providing time-temperature-transformation (TTT)
diagrams or by specifying model coefﬁcients directly using dedicated parameter and property tables.

Diffusional Transformation
A diffusional transformation is a phase change that involves the long-range diffusion of atoms as a function of
both time and temperature. The kinetics of diffusional transformations under isothermal conditions (constant
temperature ) can be described by the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami (JMA) model
where 
 is the total volume fraction of all parent and child phases participating in the transformation;
 and  are the reaction rate constant and Avrami exponent, respectively; and 
 is the equilibrium relative
total volume fraction of the parent phases. The coefﬁcients  and  can be temperature dependent, and they can
be calibrated from a time-temperature-transformation (TTT) diagram. Figure 2 shows a representative TTT
diagram illustrating a diffusional transformation (D) and a martensitic transformation (M). A transformation is
usually represented by two curves in the TTT diagram: a start curve where the transformation begins (for example,
 in Figure 2) and a ﬁnish curve where the transformation completes (for example, 
 in Figure 2).
A curve in a TTT diagram represents the time (as a function of temperature) that a transformation has completed

a certain proportion. For example, the start curve of the diffusional transformation, 
, can be represented by
the time, 
, when the transformation begins and the corresponding relative total volume fraction of child
phases,

Johnson-Mehl-Avrami (JMA) model that considers each time increment is a small isothermal step,
where 
 is the time increment size;  is the temperature at the end of the last increment; 
 is the temperature
change for the current time increment; and  is the ﬁctitious time that would provide an equivalent amount of
transformed material, 
, at a constant temperature 
:
If the diffusional transformation is reversible (
), the reverse transformation 
 can be described as
You can deﬁne the kinetics of the transformation using either a TTT diagram or calibrated JMA model coefﬁcients.

Martensitic Transformation
A martensitic transformation solely depends on temperature, as described by the Koistinen-Marburger (KM)
model,
where 
 is the temperature at the beginning of the current cooling cycle, and the martensitic start temperature
 and the transformation coefﬁcient  can be calibrated from TTT diagrams. Since a martensitic transformation
is independent of time, this type of transformation is usually represented by at least two horizontal lines in the
TTT diagram, as shown in Figure 2. For example, the start curve of the martensitic transformation can be
represented by the temperature 
 where the transformation begins and the corresponding volume fraction of
the children phases 
. Thus, the transformation coefﬁcient  can be computed as
Abaqus uses a backward Euler integration of the differential form of the original KM model,

You can specify a solidiﬁcation map for modeling grain morphology. As shown in Figure 3, given the magnitude
of thermal gradient 
 and solidiﬁcation rate

Specifying Material Properties as Functions of Metallurgical State
You can specify material properties as functions of metallurgical state. For example, thermal conductivity and
speciﬁc heat capacity can be different for raw and fused materials. This is achieved by introducing a series of
ﬁeld variables that characterize the metallurgical state and by deﬁning the material properties as a function of
those ﬁeld variables (see Specifying Material Data as Functions of Temperature and Independent Field Variables).
The metallurgical state includes material physical state, volume fraction ratio of solid phases, volume fraction
of columnar grain, and grain size. The volume fraction ratio of solid phase  (
) is deﬁned as
This deﬁnition ensures that the 
 volume fraction ratios are independent and that their values range from
0 to 1. For example, if a material has four solid phases and it is found that Young's modulus, , and Poisson's
ratio, , are different for different solid phases, the material data can be deﬁned as
0
0

0
0

where 
 and 
 are Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of solid phase , respectively.
A dedicated parameter table of type "ABQ_PHASE_TRANS_FieldVariables" is available to assign ﬁeld variables
to metallurgical state quantities.
Use the following options to assign metallurgical state quantities to ﬁeld variables
used in the deﬁnition of material properties:
Input File Usage:

Solution-Dependent State Variables
The metallurgical phase transformation framework is available as a special-purpose modeling technique that
makes use of solution-dependent state variables (SDVs) (see About User Subroutines and Utilities) for multiple
purposes, such as deﬁning initial values, output, and workspaces used for computation. You must allocate at
least 
 solution-dependent state variables, where 
 and 
 are the number of sets of data deﬁned
in the parameter tables of type "ABQ_PHASE_TRANS_SolidPhases" and
"ABQ_PHASE_TRANS_Transformations", respectively. You must ensure that those spaces are properly allocated
and not overwritten by other user subroutines. The meaning of the different SDVs is described below.
Description
Label
SDV
Raw/liquid/solid state. This variable is
varying between –1.0 to 1.0. The state is –1.0
RLS
1
if the material is raw, 0.0 if the material is
liquid, and 1.0 if the material is solid. The
state is between –1.0 and 0.0 if the material
is a mixture of raw and liquid. The state is
between 0.0 to 1.0 if the material is a mixture
of liquid and solid.
Volume fraction of columnar grain. The
variable is 0.0 if the grain is fully equiaxed,
FGRAINCOLUMNAR
2
1.0 if the grain is fully columnar, and between
0.0 and 1.0 if the grain is a mixture of
equiaxed grain and columnar grain. The
variable is –1.0 when the grain morphology
is unavailable when the material is liquid.
Grain size.
GRAINSIZE
3
Volume fraction of solid phase 1.
FPHASE_1
4
Volume fraction of solid phase 2.
FPHASE_2
5
...
...
...
Volume fraction of solid phase 
.
FPHASE_N
You can output SDV1 to SDV(
). The ordering of volume fraction of solid phases starting from SDV4
follows the ordering deﬁned in the parameter table of type "ABQ_PHASE_TRANS_SolidPhases". You can
customize a more meaningful output label of SDVs based on the name of the solid phases. For example, if phase
1 is named "alpha", you can use FPHASE_ALPHA as the output label instead of FPHASE_1.
SDV(
) to SDV(
) are workspaces used for solid-phase transformations.
Use the following option to allocate space for solution-dependent state variables:
Input File Usage:
*DEPVAR
1, RLS, “raw/liquid/solid state”
2, FGRAINCOLUMNAR, “volume fraction of columnar grain”
3, GRAINSIZE, “grain size”
4, FPHASE_1, “volume fraction of solid phase 1”    
5, FPHASE_2, “volume fraction of solid phase 2”
…
, FPHASE_N, “volume fraction of solid phase 
”

Initial Conditions
You can specify initial values of material physical state, volume fraction of solid phases, volume fraction of
columnar grain, and grain size by deﬁning initial values of the corresponding solution-dependent state variables.
For example, you can specify the initial value –1 for SDV1 to represent the initial raw material. See Deﬁning
the Initial Values of Solution-Dependent State Variables for more details.
